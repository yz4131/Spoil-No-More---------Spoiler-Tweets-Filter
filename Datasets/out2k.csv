0,True,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""
1,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
2,True,"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."
3,True,"**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one."
4,True,"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
5,True,"In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters"
6,True,"I have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time my life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in, and come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now. And I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a marriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life."
7,True,"I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright"" This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life"
8,True,"A friend of mine listed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes."
9,True,"Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's ""Cool Hand Luke"", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance."
10,True,"I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends ""Red,"" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a ""basic skills"" learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as ""Brooks,"" who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. ""you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying."" Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you ""get busy living or dying"" you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally ""free"" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, ""Bad Boys"" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in ""Shawshank,"" is just as good as a prison bully in ""Bad Boys."") Another great movie is ""Midnight Express"" which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is ""An Innocent Man,"" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time"
11,True,"To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********"
12,True,"From the director of 1990's ""Buried Alive"" comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary ""Red"", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (""whatever you want"") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema""The Shawshank Redemption"" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past ""The Shawshank Redemption.""Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre"
13,True,"Wow! what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start, so as a future film maker, i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot, it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you haven't seen it yet, go out and buy it because you won't be disappointed at all, believe you me."
14,True,"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."
15,True,"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again."
16,True,"I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. ""I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards"". Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can ""get things"" befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say ""Watch this - its the best film ever made""."
17,True,"I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation there's only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is ""a great story with great characters"".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting ""the sisters "" was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always been the ""hopeful dreamer"" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10."
18,True,"To be honest, I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. You usually get far more character development than in a movie (e.g. Puzo's The Godfather).But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears, and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office, e.g. LOTR: The Return of the King, The Godfather, but an original, stand-alone film that, in my opinion, will never be surpassed in quality"
19,True,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Not really because it's really really good but because everyone likes it! I can't think of anyone who doesn't like this movies, young, old, male, female and over the entire globe! Good Work! It's a story about a man (Tim Burton) who is cent to jail for a crime he didn't commit (the murder of his wife and lover). In jail he meets good and bad people like always. One of them is Morgan Freeman. He is the guy who can get you anything you want. Because Tim Burton is innocent and a very intelligent guy he is desperately trying to find a way out of this jail. The relationship between Tim Burton and the rest of his jail-mates can be touching but also horrible and with some violence. This is a great ""feelgood"" movie about hope, love, hate and freedom!"
20,True,"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as ""Red"" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too ""easy"" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10."
21,True,"It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a ""bad"" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto ""favorite movie"" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb ""best movie"" list. In reality, ""Shawshank"" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their ""favorite movie"". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear."
22,True,"Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and I said, ""I haven't even seen it."" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good ""wordsmith."" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the ""twists"" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really ""realistic"" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a ""fable"" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, ""movie music"" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or ""bad"" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed ""nicely"" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not."
23,True,"'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing."
24,True,"This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to ""submarine""-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama ""The Green Mile"", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that ""I've seen this all before""-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 ""I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic."
25,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10!"
26,True,"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times."
27,True,"Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 ""because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3"" and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I can't tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I don't know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people don't understand how Andy ""pinned"" the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of ""how he put the poster back up after entering the hole"" because the poster never gets taken down."
28,True,"***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was listed at #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to ""get things"" from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times."
29,True,"There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank."
30,True,"Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch."
31,True,"An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences."
32,True,"This majestic movie is about Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover after discovering she had been cheating on him. He gets impounded with two life sentences in the Shawshank Prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who befriends him, and as the story moves along slowly, he eventually understands what Andy once told him: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Andy is persistent in his quest to be free. And he tries to convince Red during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good thing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come face to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed itself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works of modern drama. And the slow pace of the movie only helps further to sink you in its mood, and leave you satisfied with a strange bitter sweet feeling in the end."
33,True,"The reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the IMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there are so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE ""Citizen Kane""?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood movie and just doesn't venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader's interest throughout and are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn't really make any very interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or evil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his ""good"" characters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the ""evil"" characters seem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For example, Clancy Brown's prison guard and Bob Gunton's warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they exist? To make the protagonist's life a living hell. For no other reason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin's prison escape makes you go ""woohoo"" and jump up and down in your chair, it's just not a very feasible plot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY notices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don't usually have a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It is otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn't sit right with me. ****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be happy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is technically fine, but there's nothing new in that department. The villains are completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except for their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own conclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience is basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The movie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of ten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but it is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one. Among them, ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"", ""Papillon"", and ""Cool Hand Luke"". See these first before you give this movie a ten out of ten."
34,True,"I don't write film reviews normally, but this is no normal film. i never tire of watching the Shawshank redemption not because of its sheer brilliance but because of all the intertwining emotions portrayed by the characters.The film begins slowly but Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) has a strange, intriguing style unfamiliar with that of a normal inmate jailed for 2 life sentences. As the film progresses it's almost like you know the characters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel andy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate to Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name there is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it' As the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to happen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film"
35,True,"The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so much but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom and they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading this still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250."
36,True,"I didn't see the film in the cinema, because I was too young at 14, though when I did rent it on video, and subsequently DVD, it was and is still to this day the best movie I have ever hired out, and Now I have the DVD with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much complete. It's true what they say about this having an impact on people's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something special to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. The way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another excellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No that description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece and if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be disappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in throat."
37,True,"I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best."
38,True,"Some consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced film-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The Shawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a movie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using black-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some saints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to get through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or negative characteristics."
39,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love or  well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and ideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to prison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again, we see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope destroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were played as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the script.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches, and no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film  yes, even enjoy it. But please don't think it's one of the best."
40,True,"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity  everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final ""hug on the beach"" scene. Wait this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it does."
41,True,"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!"
42,True,"The Shawshank Redemption offers a life lesson; that no matter what, hope must never be lost. Hope is a good thing. In addition, it shows the true benefits of friendship, of those that care for you.Andy Dufresne was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders of his wife and the ""fella she was banging."" Inside, he meets Red. Red will learn a lesson from Andy, that hope cannot be stripped from you, no matter what is done to you, no matter what happens, no matter how we suffer, hope will always be there to comfort us. Andy's education gets him benefits with the warden, who makes him his ""financial pet"" for his money laundering activities. He does not know however, that his world is going to come crashing down on him.This movie has had a very poignant and influential impact on myself. I do not get tired of seeing it, and every time I do, I feel like nothing in this world can hurt me. Only one word comes to my mind when describing the power and beauty of this movie. Perfect.Hope will set you free."
43,True,"I have a friend who hasn't seen the Shawshank Redemption, and his comment was essentially this: ""I hate prison movies, and I hate religion movies, so I'm not gonna see a flick that has both aspects in it."" His loss. This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my all-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can learn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that Tim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle level, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords him the opportunity to become a ""good"" man for the first time in his life. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in some of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great literature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas' last name from ""Dumbass"" to the correct ""Dumah"") The last quarter of the movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes, just look at how popular ""Scrooge"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have become over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss."
44,True,"(slight spoilers, nothing crucial) This is a competent movie, but its presence in the rankings completely baffles me -- it might as well be 'The Pelican Brief'. Its scenes are schematics into which emotion might be put (for example, the schematic of the despairing ex-prisoner Red), but they lack the ragged richness of real feeling.  Where 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' overwhelms us, this shows us a series of events."
45,True,"The basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie, having now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen from Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go watch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont"
46,True,"Definitely NOT your ordinary Stephan King adaptation. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the few movies I've seen, where emotion and story are perfectly blended into one absolutely AMAZING story! You can feel the terror from Andy's trial, you can feel the happiness from the beer on the roof scene,the anger from scenes involving The Sisters, the shock when he learns that Tommy was killed, and the hope, joy and happiness gathered together when Andy escapes.The acting was amazing, the adaptations from the book were spot-on, this is the greatest adaptation I have ever seen. Of all the people in the world, I have never met one person who didn't enjoy it.If you haven't seen it; why are you sitting there? Go out and rent it and see for yourself, how amazing this film is!"
47,True,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10"
48,True,"** Some spoilers about the general storyline **I had some expectations regarding this movie, because of the excellent rating it got here. To start with the positive: the acting (especially by the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some scenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful prison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of course) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend (mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who turns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his corrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way in which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice drama with good acting and good camera. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy movie, though."
49,True,"Over-long, boring, tedious, over-acted and very very very very very OVER-RATED. Hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote this the 2nd best film EVER!! I first saw the cut down version lasting 1 hour 25 minutes, and it was still too long.I wouldn't mind but it's so drawn-out, fanciful and pathetic. The things that happen in that prison would never happen, just because some nerdy bank manager has ""hope..."" Give me a break! Which soap opera did that sad line come from! No wonder it was initially ignored, and it should be continued to be ignored. Robbins, who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover, never ages. At one point he HAS TO ""remind"" us he's been in jail for 12 years, because it only looks like a week.Yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006. He looks a much older man. And of course he does, he's 12 years older!! In the Shamshank Dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years, and his hair is even cut the same style.Even when we then go forward something like 20 years, he still looks the same, never aged at all, apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides. And after he escapes (after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver), he meets up with his old buddy Freeman, who got out of jail legally. And get this, BOTH look younger than when they first went in.By my reckoning Tim Robbins should now be about 70, and Morgan Freeman in his early 80s, yet both after serving their time still look barely 40.And what a load of talkative rubbish. The most boring over-hyped-up film in history. Complete twaddle. God knows how on earth I watched all of it, but I did if for a bet, 'cause I cannot stand it. Wasn't worth a UK tenner anyway!! My vote, 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama.Get a life, if this is the ""best"" film you've even seen. Better still, get a cinema ticket!!!! Or rent a DVD. And more than one!!"
50,True,"The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made."
51,True,"Where do I start? When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I immediately wanted to watch it, mostly of its title, so as I always do I looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather, but no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with ""Red"" walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast."
52,True,"I had heard a lot about this movie being a 'classic' and a 'must-see' and normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because unrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. This movie, however, managed to surpass all my expectations.I didn't know much concerning the story, except that it was a movie set in a prison but it's so much more than that. The major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered 'heroes' or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it, when the world is doing its best to crush it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on-screen chemistry is amazing. There are no weak scenes, no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about the movie, they make you believe, they make you hope."
53,True,"Personally I was, and I am ashamed to say this, quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold The Shawshank Redemption within their Top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. If you're wondering mine is ""The Princess Bride"", childhood favourite but that's beside the point.I think the first time I watched it was in 2006 and I instantly fell in love with it. I now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and I am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end.If you use the old analogy of ""If an alien came to earth show them how..."" to make a film, you would show them this as the blueprint.Just brilliant."
54,True,"I'd heard about this film a few years ago and I'd heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasn't good, It was outstanding! I can't believe I never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film because it's realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping, you can't take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!"
55,True,"This film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates:""There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.""It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crime:""There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.""It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you need to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/"
56,True,"This review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review.Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didn't go well in the box office. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. Sometimes life doesn't make any sense at all. Some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still won't succeed in their life. These people are forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is ""hope"" which you should need until the moment you die. If you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed my way of looking the life."
57,True,"There have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was written. With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works in both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well written and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison, where he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played terrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen King, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best writing. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump, which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset. I prefer Pulp fiction, but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made.The Shawshank redemption:A+"
58,True,"This is a very, very, very, great film. It's my all time favorite. First of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the entire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar! The fact that he didn't is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover, so he is sentenced to Shawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner named Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out."
59,True,"Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen."
60,True,"This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as ""great"" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words......"
61,True,"This is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan Freeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his movies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch when it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen anything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if you haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If you are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10"
62,True,"When Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains rape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank Darabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and moves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond redemption! Watch it!"
63,True,This movie has many stories to tell. Every scene has its own story. I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.
64,True,"I'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine."
65,True,"Much has been written and praised (deservedly so) about ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on and be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human achievement."
66,True,"Why Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about stories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the most powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free."
67,True,"When you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not saying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant) they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning and a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red (wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely evil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's life comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film, people criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe, it stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The Godfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!"
68,True,"I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things."
69,True,"I am a 38 Years old man from england who works for the second biggest oil company in the world.........I have : lovely family......great friends.....good job.......The film is perfect time and time again every time you watch it !!! Talking Points , Settings & locations , Actors , So much feeling , fantastic score , and everybody involved in the production produced a masterpiece..........Extra special thanks to Frank Darabont ( i sincerely hope you are very happy and everything in your life is good )..............A total must have in the collection.............Thank you Trev"
70,True,"Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece."
71,True,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these ""threats to society"", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms, we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!"
72,True,The Shawshank Redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films I have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. An it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the Shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as Andy get one over the Worden and escapes the cells to freedom
73,True,"I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally ""get it"", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of the best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King adaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?"
74,True,"I think the shawshank redemption is the best film ever made. It is considered as a drama, but in my opinion this fantastic and entertaining movie has no genre. In my country (Argentina) not a lot of people has seen it but i'm trying to change that situation by recommending it to everybody. Despite not having a great success while it was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people is having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from their boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the story makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and unexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that when the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more because the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a masterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie would be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't know really how to express myself. So if haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? just put your shoes on a go running to the video and i know you'll enjoy it. I would like to know who is Allen Greene, i'll get very happy if you e mail me back telling me who he is. Simply the best movie ever made."
75,True,"This movie will be one of my favorite's of all time, it's heartwarming, sad, funny at times and won't let you down. justice is served! Morgan Freeman plays the supporting character for Tim Robbins and just made the movie. He creates so much emotion to this film as the narrator and supporting character to the storyline it just leaves you in total awe of his talent."
76,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most uplifting, its have been 23 years but it's still one of the best classic movie ever i saw, morally satisfying films of the '90s. Not because it's religious  God never visits Shawshank  but because this is a story of finding hope in an unshakable friendship between two human beings. i almost saw it 20 times. it's give you a perfect taste of this movie. Trust me you can feel it."
77,True,"We just do not get movies like these anymore. The Shawshank Redemption is a film about two men who bond in prison and seek justice. In its 2hrs and 22 minutes of run time, this film just does disappoint. It is full of present themes like integrity, friendship, good vs evil, and the most important theme of hope. Hope. Hope which drives a man seeking redemption in the worst circumstances. Hope of reuniting with a friend after decades of injustice (minor spoiler). And Hope that with powerful friendship and spirit, one can overcome any obstacles. In terms of technical merit this film is also very well shot, with 360 degree camera movement giving the audience a feeling of what it feels like to be in prison. In its acting, Tim Robbins convincingly plays Andy Dufresne, a man who has suffered from injustice. Morgan Freeman sells his performance of a Ellis Redding, who follows in on Andy's belief of hope. Needless to say, Morgan Freeman's narration is perhaps the best narration in recent years. Most of the characters in the film are given great emotional arcs with wonderful dialogue. The music in the film is also played really well. Undoubtedly, this movie deserves a 10/10."
78,True,"Excellent movie, I have watched it twice no thrice :) very thrilling :). The characters fulfilled their roles very good. The graphics was astonishing in my eyes. If you want to enjoy these movie watch this in HD format. It was very memorable to watch such kind of movie. The shawshank redemption is included in my top ten favorite to watch. I will give it an excellent score."
79,True,One of the best movies out there. It is definitely worthy of its number one spot for so many years. I am never bored of re watching it. The cast was excellent and the story unfolds in smooth transition. Amazing narration by an amazing actor and one of my personal favorites Mr. Morgan Freeman. Love the music and the build up to the escape is one of the most amazing escapes story wise.
80,True,"This is one of my favorite films. I watched it several times and was ready watch constantly. Each frame is beautiful, the story is amazing. The film goes for a long time, this time flies by unnoticed. If somebody not yet seen, then I advise you to look, and it is better not to time. The actors play is amazing! Thanks for this movie"
81,True,"I was really hoping to be able to give this movie a much higher rating than this, because in the previews it looked great.I honestly feel a little cheated, because I think that this movie had tons of potential, and I do believe that when they were making it, they probably saw it, but for one reason or another, it was lost."
82,True,"The Shawshank Redemption begins with young Andy Dufresne, a young vice-president of a Portland, Maine bank, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and who is sent to Shawshank Prison to live out the rest of his life. There, he learns how adapt to life in prison and learns lessons about life through fellow prison inmates who become his friends. Nineteen years later, Andy finally leaves the confines of Shawshank, on his very own terms.Andy is intelligent and although rather naÃ¯V in the beginning, he is able to adapt to life within prison by learning from Red who takes a liking to Andy's quiet nature. He is resourceful, as shown when it is revealed at the end of the film that he has planned his escape and life after that flawlessly with only resources made available to him in prison. Andy keeps his hope of freedom alive throughout the years with strength and determination. With integrity, Andy is able to make sure that he does not succumb to anything which may become his downfall.Red, who's real name is Ellis Boyd Reading, is the man who ""I'm the guy whocan get it for you,"" he narrates. The long years in Shawshank has Red 'institutionalised', and he can no longer imagine life on the outside, nor does he expect it. Red is better at perception, as he can see in Andy what others cannot, and befriends the younger man.Warden Samuel Norton is both God-fearing and greedy. He quotes many passages from the Bible throughout the story, but has no qualms in ordering murder to protect his ill-gotten money. He is selfish and destroys any chance for Andy's re-trial by getting rid of Tommy. The fact that he shoots himself after the police come to arrest him shows that Samuel Norton is a weak man who cannot bear the burden of his crimes make-shift desk and provides financial advice services for guards and the warden. Andy is also determined, and the others are aware of his nature.Andy's Blind Self incorporates his quiet nature which tend to be misinterpreted as arrogance by is fellow prison inmates. The judge at his trial for the murder of his wife and her lover in the beginning of the film asserts that Andy seems to be ""a particularly icy and remorseless man"". It would seem like Andy's mannerisms have worked against him in that situation. If he had been aware of the way others perceived him, he may have been able to prevent himself from sending out the wrong message.Andy's strength and determination play important roles in his Hidden Self. When Andy first steps foot into Shawshank, Red makes a bet that Andy would be the first one to cry. ""Lookedlike a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man,"" Red says. But Andy proves Red wrong. He is stronger than anyone thinks. Red gets Andy the rock hammer which Andy says is for his rock collection hobby, and when the tool arrives, Red dismisses the thought that Andy would use it to escape prison. A series of posters covers the tunnel Andy is working on in the wall, and his daily walks outside is used to dispose of the rubble from his digging. Although his determination later morphs into a trait of Andy's Known Self, his resourcefulness is hidden by the facade of a straight and sometimes dull man.The Emotional Self comes into play when Andy seeks redemption. Despite the fact that Andy is innocent of the crime he is accused of committing, Andy feels that he has caused her death indirectly by not giving her enough love and attention. He says; ""I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am."" He feels guilty for something beyond his control, and neither he nor others know why The Shawshank Redemption takes depth in the basis of human communication; perception. Before the ending of the film, the viewer takes on almost a similar perception towards Andy as Red as the story is from Red's point of view. However, at the end of the film, the viewer learns that what we perceive about somebody or something, may turn out to be something else at the end of the day."
83,True,"In a world plagued with mediocre movies designed to sell a franchise and merchandising, rather than simply tell a captivating story, The Shawshank Redemption stands head and shoulders above any other. The manner in which it's apparent beautiful simplicity is built upon by adding layer upon layer of complex sub-stories and plot twists is absolutely unrivalled. The story centres around a central character, banker Andy Dufresne, an innocent man struggling with the injustice of being sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and her lover, but expands with sub stories of greed, retribution, friendship and hope in a way that would please any viewer if these plots were simply allowed to unfold alongside each other. What this film does so well though, and what elevates it from just 'good', is the way it intertwines these stories with a roller-coaster of twists and turns that give every character an utterly believable depth and requires even the most cynical viewer to dispense with the notion of 'suspension of disbelief'. Nothing is unrealistic, nothing is over the top, nothing is under explained and so nothing is unbelievable. The film is also littered with Easter egg like ironies that reward those who allow themselves to be utterly immersed within the story, such as the warden's choice of wall coverings and his words when returning an inmates bible. The film also forces viewers to empathise, not only with the protagonist, but also many of the supporting characters in a way few would imagine they could... considering the majority of them are criminals... including, it would seem, many of those who we expect not to be. In summary, on one level, if you just want a film that tells an interesting story with a happy ending, this is one you should enjoy... if you demand more from a film then this is to be considered mandatory viewing. In short, having seen this film, from plot...to acting... to cinematography, you will be left with a benchmark to measure all others by... and a sense of joy, that you will one day be presented with something even better, and a deep sense of disappointment that you know you likely never will be."
84,True,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul"
85,True,"In the beginning, I thought that the movie will be as much movies I have seen before, with a routine plot that talk on someone in some prisons try to escape with the help of a prison guard. but, what I saw is so different, a smart man worked hardly to gain his freedom without letting anyone Know What he was thinking. The movie was so hopeful and exciting, and he let you think who to use your clever in such bad situations, that was 2 hour of my life and I am so happy to having been the ""The Shaw-shank Redemption"" in my watch-list, so thank you and thank you IMDb to give me this chance to share my opinion in this movie."
86,True,"Andy is introduced to the library by Brooks in 1949. Brooks points out a Louis L'Amour section, but L'Amour's first book under his own name wasn't published until 1953 (he had written a series of Hopalong Cassidy novels in the late 1940s under the name Tex Burns), and didn't produce enough books to warrant his own section until the 1960's. He was still somewhat known having written many short stories for pulp magazines, but these featured many writers and stories. Brooks also points out a section of Reader's Digest Condensed Books, which were first published in 1950. and When Red's (Ellis Boyd Redding) parole form is stamped by the parole board, the typeface on the form is called American Typewriter which was not invented until 1974. The typeface is also not monospaced as a manual typewriter would, meaning it was most likely printed by a modern computer."
87,True,"When I saw that this movie was top of the IMDb top 250 charts, I was quite intrigued and wanted to watch it right away, and it didn't disappoint.The IMDb summary of the movie was quite misleading. I thought it'll just be about the friendship of Andy and Red and I was loving the movie when the real meaning of the movie came forward. It was not just a prison movie. It was a prison break movie. What a lively ending. When you see a film, you somehow anticipate that some twist is going to happen. Like the movies with crazy twists are generally thrillers or dark films and you know the twist is coming, but you are just eager to know what it is. That is not true with this movie. I would never in my right mind even imagined that there could be a twist to this movie. It is such a simple beautiful movie and then BANG!In closing, I just want to quote Andy from the film""Hope is a good thing Red, maybe the best of things. And good things never come to and end""BRILLIANT!"
88,True,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life! This is real entertainment!!!! I enjoyed the entire story from the beginning to the end and I would watch this movie everyday all day because it is very outstanding compared to other movies of this age. There must have been so much work put into this production and I don't know how the actors could have performed so well!!! I have to say, I will recommend this movie to everyone I know and I won't resist the fact to talk about this movie all day! This is one of my most favorite movies of all time, o compare it to the shining and the godfather, but the shaw shank redemption comes a out on top!"
89,True,"The Shawshank Redemption stands as a truly great film. It is not an action movie, so time is taken to set up the characters. Based on a short story by Stephen King (which is truly extraordinary), the plot follows a man wrongly convicted for murdering his wife. The rest of the movie follows his time spent in Shawshank Prison. Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, this movie turned out to be a box office flop; ironically, it went on to become one of the most rented movies of 1995 (similar to It's A Wonderful Life). And since then, it has become the top rated movie on this website. This movie is not action packed, but it is packed full of emotion. Beware of watching it: you may become addicted to it. And that is a good thing."
90,True,"This movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie, that I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life could be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10"
91,True,"It's about the redemption to the prisoner. Or to everybody in the world. Whatever,whenever,wherever,people would make something mistake can't hand on.People always try to control everything but things always out of control. The Shawshank Redemption had many things out of control and he try.We know it ,but we can't stop to trying to do that.And I think I write something wrong words. Not spell English well,but I try. First time use IMDb, first time use English web-page.Thank you"
92,True,"The review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and as time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part of the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as ""Red"" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is ""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies."""
93,True,"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus-load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."

95,True,"Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.heres a ordinary film about a prison where the whole place become the most important character in this movie it cast a long shadow over the film with high walls on every shot with that the characters in this film play their part well a small film that garnered 7oscar nominations has gone on to legendary cult status on DVD and number 1 on IMDb success didn't come it easy like the life sentence handed down to two men who becomes friends so we see this prison as amazing architecture so we see Morgan freeman character red seeing the the see new meat come into his yard set in the 40s Andy dufresne quiet man who is young a successful banker who finds who has being wrongly committed of murder or framed for his wife's death Tim Robbins plays the character well like cream rising to the top waiting for his chance of redemption he is strong character helps in her as fear in there can be smelled a mile away he meets his new family and the guards Clancy Brown ... Captain Hadley / and governerWarden Norton / who likes to run the place efficently but takes no s**t but as red is the the fixer who can get everything dufresne is an unusual like unconventional prisoner he love hope but blots out the outside world his music in his heart in prison you can get touched but nobody can touch your music the strength is that friendship anywhere can stand the test of time even 20 years on the inside with the gurards knowing the need help with their finances he starts his business up in the prison so he keeps the appearance up that everything is not what seems he helps get the prisoners drinks while helping with the roof and overhearing prison guards problems plus keeping them on side when he complains about that he need help in his office he gets his mates starting a business in the jail with the accounts with a old inmate Brooks Hatlen played by a great actor James Whitmore showing what life has done for him .when Andy makes complaints to the prison about a library and letters to the prison board he keeps getting rejected but as dogged as he was with all the time in the world he keeps doing it until funds come in to open a proper library in a prison the first of its kinds but the fixer gets Andy things for him that has questions for Andy but no never shows his poker face plus fouling everyone Andy lets out music into the fellow prisoners much to the the disgust of officers who let Andy away with allot including posters i wont give away the climax of this film as its exhilarating as faith hope selfless and carefree who sees away about life Andy does it deserved Oscar and got none as Andy learned were there a will there away of not fearing of high wall but freeing ones hope of life thats better than being framed but conspiring against ones who persecuted him revenge is sweet As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."" life is a beach or so they say"
96,True,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all- time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it."
97,True,"I have seen the movie for the first time. It's a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. Things are happening you don't expect and that's good for a movie. It's also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice, and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it, but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction, and so on... .One point can be better: the characters doesn't become older when the movie progresses.But a well-deserved 10/10."
98,True,"One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie, apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
99,True,"The Shawshank Redemtion ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite film for many reasons. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, the film is executed brilliantly and expertly directed by Frank Darabont. The film is sad yet uplifting and has many iconic scenes. The writing is almost perfect with all the characters being well-developed. The film keeps us informed as to the lead characters' thoughts and emotions. The score was incredible with Roger Deakins cinematography and it was beautifully portrays 19 years of life in a corrupt and brutal prison. Tim Robbins delivers an incredible performance, as does Morgan Freeman. All of the supporting cast were great from the Warden to Captin Hadley. The film's ending is perfect, moving and justice for Andy delivers the feel good factor. It's a powerful film which should have dominated the Oscars."
100,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that shows courage, patience, and determination. We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with persistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of the movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part but you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays through. You will really would not believe that a certain person could make a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine how the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as long as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we can be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching. You may find it boring on the early part, don't be bothered, finish it, surely you will enjoy."
101,True,"This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over!"
102,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent film, and I love love always, but this overrated, apparently there are three visions current world, those who believe that citing Kane is the best movie of film history. 2 say it is a life sentence for the popular media vote, and those who believe other things and mostly know that there is the best movie in the world. Without a doubt, one biennium film, the protagonist is a character you acutes very easily and that story is impossible that you are not put goosebumps. The cast Maimonides as the rest of the movie. Not die without seeing this masterpiece. It's the kind of movies I want to find me when I rush to see one or when payment movie to see, for this reason I put it a 10."
103,True,"In 1947 Andy Dufresne, vice president of a bank in Portland is accused of killing his wife and lover of this, a famous golfer, and sentenced to life imprisonment for each although no conclusive evidence of authorship , being sent to Shawshank.He is above the average of others who believe a snob, though Red, one of the most popular men prisoners get to ask everything you like and soon become friends, which does not relieve you of fall into the hands of ""Sisters"", about homosexuals who do not leave you alone. Red lends a hand and you choose to fix a roof outside the prison. There listens Andy financial problems of a guardian and offers to save. That makes his fame transcends and in a few years made the statements of all of his prison guards and other county. It also serves to definitely get rid of your stalkers, of concern to guard. He also placed in charge of the prison library, where you write a letter every week to the Senate for funds to it, with its insistence getting the best prison library in all of New England.But see also the despair inside, having spent his entire life in prison does not want to go outside where everything is hostile to them. The old Brooks, former manager of the library outside is nothing and commits suicide.He has a special treatment to keep the accounts of the corrupt warden, that prisoners performing work with which anyone can compete, and companies who want to work you must pay a hefty commission that Andy becomes white money, inventing a fictitious character where even get legal papers.Andy is also responsible for helping those who wish to study, including Tommy, a boy who wants to change his life. Thanks to him, Tommy manages to get the graduate. And is the guy who tells him that in one of the prisons in which he was matched with a guy who told her he had killed a golfer and his mistress and the fact that her husband accused her. Andy sees in confession a glimmer of hope, which is truncated by the warden, that does not help and ends with the only thread of hope, making kill Tommy. Andy himself will spend two months in solitary confinement for refusing to follow accounting warden.The output will return to it, but that night disappears from his cell without anyone knowing what happened to him, until they discover a tunnel after a large poster of Raquel Welch. And once outside, the bank will draw up character warden $ 300,000, in addition to sending a letter with proof of corruption all the press. Norton commits suicide.Some time later, after 40 years in prison is released Network For him, life on the outside is as absurd as to Brooks, and think back to crime to return to their ""home"". It only holds a promise I made to Andy that he would go to a field where there was something for him. He does and finds enough money to go to the place where Andy said that if one day be installed leaving a Mexican village by the Pacific where a hotel ride. Red goes there to be his assistant.Great movie, you see them."
104,True,"This was a reflection of the 'count of Montecristo', especially the jailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the future and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and all, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be true.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go."
105,True,"There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects (it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental innovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie). But because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great characters.""They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take."" The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a repressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks can't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you.""Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right in.""Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive.""- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There is something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking about? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea.""But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. ""Discipline and the bible."" And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. ""I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.""Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of Brooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And certainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.""I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying."""
106,True,This movie is the best of all times.All the actors are in their high limits of their performs.When you are watching the movie you just feel you are in that prison and living all these things like they suffered all the pains.And I need to say something about Morgan Freeman.His voice and his role is perfect in this movie. you are just watching out of breath during the movie.I don't know but maybe I watched this movie more than three and every time ı am finding new things that ı couldn't see before.Also the story is unique and different than other prison movies.I am describing in that way because before and after this film there are a lot of movies about prison life.To give this prison life emotions you need to find some specific things which would grab audiences' attention.
107,True,"""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no fairy-tale world."". I think this line by Morgan Freeman pretty much sums up the whole film! Amazing film written by one of the most interesting writers of our time. Steven King, who is often known for giving us fantastical horror stories, brings to the table one of the most realistic terror tales imaginable. Andy, a banker, finds himself accused of a crime, and is sent to prison. There, he is faced with the challenges of survival while maintaining hope, to one day find his freedom. In his journey he makes an unlikely bond with fellow inmates and is able to enlighten them with things they never dreamed possible. This is a definite must see film."
108,True,The Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is set in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to prison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another man during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the perfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice it's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long and that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does somethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change to the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to read and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the prison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was just fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this: Mr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and then he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from prison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each other and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be violent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times. Anyone that has not here is the trailer : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco. My name is Henry and if you want to see more reviews check out my page but for now goodbye.
109,True,"it's very good film i watched it more than 10 times i like scene of the actress on the wall and the plan to escape i loved the actor personality Morgan was protector to the movie i liked prison manager in acting all actors were perfect i adore adore adore this movie i will watch all movies of this actor thank you a lot but i need to know it;s areal history or not ? as someone told me it's real but i can't believe that cleverness , beverage scene was good when he solved the problem of the officer , i need to see all movies of prisons as prison break but i don't know names as i'm Egyptian can't now more American movies so i need help in that"
110,True,"Tim Robbins as Andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged, and sent to the Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit.Morgan Freeman as Red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to Andy. In order for Andy to help the young man cope with prison as Red is really used to it having lived there for years.Red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes, posters of Rita Hayworth to Andy among other things. As people at the prison look up to him. Red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way.Both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. As both need to lean on one another to survive. And Andy is beaten up by Mark Rolston, as Red and his thugs and after Red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as Andy is no longer bothered again. In the process, Andy is moved from the laundry job.Andy works with the corrupt warden Sam Norton(played evilly by Bob Gunton), and corrupt and sadistic guard Captain Hadley(Clancy Brown), in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally.Andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times, once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. Who in turn, would take away his job and the library he has been working at.As he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. And with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from Red, to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. He wants something more to do that than.Won't tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. A movie of hope and encouragement. As it shows you should never, ever give up hope as that keeps you going.Robbins and Freeman make a great duo. And the chemistry between them looks really real. Great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players! Really you will love this movie if you had not seen it."
111,True,Yes! it's absolutely true.Recently I had gone to a DVD shop. I found this movie and bought it. SHAWSANK REDEMPTION is a never before never again movie. One man is accused by murder case that he did not do that. after he becomes a prisoner. in that prison another man finds him and they becomes close friends. but that man never loses his hope to be a free man. he makes his all prison life to find a solution to live as free man in the world and he does some things to ensure this to come true. then he finds and makes his life absolutely free. This amazing movie was directed by frank darabont with original story by stepen king. afterwards this movie was nominated for seven Oscars including best picture. but won nothing. I don't hesitate to say it's a evergreen movie all time in everyone's life.
112,True,"I absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me goosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this movie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an intriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting, but with these people and their conversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad when I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but when I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until the movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone."
113,True,"What can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on about when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012). The story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by the awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at the end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5"
114,True,"What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others"
115,True,"Plot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get things'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with Haywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss."
116,True,"I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again."
117,True,"Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it. This normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles with it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery (the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG DAMN hurry) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar circumstances confesses, ""Terrible thing to live in fear"" The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red."
118,True,"The first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the french Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A few weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and brought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough). It remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the telling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the moment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect with the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the great Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events and almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a story from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience definitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally talented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my opinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character attempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted into the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the IMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the other convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the character, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the inmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just because of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this film was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who plays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad tale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it. James Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and if its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only problem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why the need to see this great piece of cinema"
119,True,"Seeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the end, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over... His life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything he lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a fugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse."
120,True,"When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10"
121,True,"People wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its just purely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the story of a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then it's got to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a musical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!"
122,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Shawshank"" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. ""Now Andy this"" and ""Andy that"". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries ""Shawshank this"" and ""Shawhank that"" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who ""looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"" a ""tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass"". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!"
123,True,"I can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The Shawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but considering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull movie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for some entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything else but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent guy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is such a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted, escapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of anything more nice to say about this movie."
124,True,"At the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number one movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd film I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the top film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven King. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the movie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank Darabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is to have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out of the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that? Later, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his name changed to ""I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry"", and the most he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his sub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One cannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the spirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can find more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The story takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to actually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells where they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on IMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as they glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet shagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this movie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer section just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might get interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed. Honestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through sh*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only seems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The music is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from the already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine. As the phrase says, ""ignorance is bliss""."
125,True,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe. In conclusion, I don't see how this movie even got the Best Picture nomination back in '94, I guess the Academy felt sorry for this film. You should either get busy livin' watching true classics that are below this film on the Top 250, or get busy dyin' watching this garbage.
0/10"
126,True,"This film deserves something like a 7 or an 8, but I have been forced to score it drastically in some attempt to right the terrible injustice that has been done.WHO is voting this film so highly? It is a nice film. A NICE film. IT IS NOT THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!! I can only assume it has been voted as such because people liked the ""shocking"" ending and the happiness brought to them by Morgan Freeman's voice caressing their ears.There is also a seriously unpleasant rape scene in there, none of the characters do very much, and there is a particularly depressing suicide scene. How any of this makes for 9.3/10, I have no idea. Can people stop giving films ridiculous ratings, so that people like me have to counterbalance those (undeserved) ratings with mean ones? Please? Just say no."
127,True,"I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not."
128,True,"Awesome movie
nyc
very goodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"
129,True,"This movie was okay, but it had coleslaw in it too much. I think if we take the coleslaw out of the motion picture industry, I would be relieved."
130,True,Best tv show ever i love this show so much and i hope the audience of this tv show loved it and i gave this show 10 rates !!!!
131,True,"I selected this movie because the obvious well rating that it has in here, and i thought it was weird because i have never heard of this movie in real life (what a shame!) This movie works by the hope of prisioners, and hope it's underrated, but it can literally move the world, i think with this movie you realize how important is having hope in your life, you cannot go aroung being a negative person that will kill you fast. 
We all feel conected to this brilliant film because none of us imdb's writers have the perfect life, it just doesn't exist. We all need hope, this movie is beautifully encouraging us to get what we want, nothing makes you feel better than someone telling you ""You can do it, i believe in you"", i guess that's how we humans work.
I love how they made us love the characters, not just the protagonist, how they made us cry, they succeed! They filled us with feelings, they made us think.
Anyone that wants to get into filmmaking or writting of some sort should see this movie very carefully because it is a masterpiece.
Totally not overrated, totally recommended!"
132,True,"When i first watched this movie, i did not expect much. My expectations were wrong. The Shawshank Redemption is one of a kind. It is not the best movie i ever watched but it is on my ""Top 5"" list. Outstanding performance of Morgan Freeman and other cast deserves more recognition. But someone would ask me sooner or later, why 9?
Story is well known, young banker was found quilty of a crime he did not commit. Through his life in prison, we saw many things, good and bad. Too bad that prisons are unexpectable so everything can go wrong. And it did go wrong. Tommy was killed only because he knew too much. When you go in jail, you stay in jail, whether you are quilty or not. That part of the movie, when we need to think, what will happen to Andy, is the most suprising and intense part of the movie. Yes, he escaped. He planned it for a long, long time. He was patient and he believed that he can prove his innocence. Everything is great, but there are some small things that stopped me from pressing ""The 10th"" star.1. There are movies that are better than ""The Shawshank Redeption"".
2. Giving 10 out of 10 would be unfair for future movies.
3. Mystery is poking my brain. Nothing much, but ending was not for my taste.It's an outstanding movie, one of a kind, with a few flaws, nothing more. I enjoyed watching this movie. Feeling while watching movie is also important. I usually rely on my feelings also when rating movies, maybe it's positive, maybe it's negative, i don't really know, but it works for me. While i was watching this movie, my feeling was ""Summer"" type. ""Summer"" type feelings are good thing, everything is orange, warm summer wind and god rays appears in my mind. Source of this feeling is not known, but hey it's my head, maybe i am too much nostalgic these days."
133,True,"There are many movies that deal with prison-related stories.It has already been 20 years since this movie came out, and it seems like I have already become accustomed to this story with similar movies. So, if you watch this movie right now, you do not seem to be impressed.The message that you should not lose hope in any situation seems to be an important motif in the movie. It is the same as before or now.PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good. ^^"
134,True,"But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,"
135,True,"Not a bad film and good to show u teens if they are not being good as I'm sure this film would make them think twice about miss behaving any more.not a bad film, seen it a few times now and when ever its on TV I watch it. Got a few sick bits in it.like when the blokes jump him in and do u no what."
136,True,"this movie is a fantastic. Because freedom is the most important thing, while innocent is imprisoned and you will be oppressed there.. and learn that you have to find your way.. and fight it. I thing if you don,t see this movie lose it. i started see movies by this film. this film have best Actors such as Morgan Freeman . his my love ."
137,True,"A masterpiece ...Even a stone heart would melt after it runs its full length.Its amazing how the movie connects to you.Morgan is a gem, his narration gives you the feel.The movie is well edited and to the point (credits to the editor),like describing the first day in the prison,or to the scene where Librarian commits suicide to make us see what is institutionalization (yeah that word!!!). The movie grips you tight when Red starts to take the same path as another old man out of prison. You heave a sigh of relief when Andrew breathes free..."
138,True,"In the words of a friend of the most astounding and most memorable criminal films that will strike you up for 117 minutes with fears and fears ... It's a movie made by a German cinema that sparkles the world of its silent cinema With Metropolis, he is undoubtedly one of the best directors ever in the history of cinema ... apart from the unsurpassed play of actors such as killer actress (Peter Laura) ... decoupage, museums, decor, music, and the language and the language of each image. It's a masterpiece, and maybe this is the image of the long-awaited omen of the cinematic cinema that has been made for years for that film."
139,True,"The Shawshank Redemption 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.' (Darabont, 1994). These insightful words changed the cinema experience forever. In 1994, Frank Darabont released his ninth film, The Shawshank Redemption, just one of his cinematic triumphs. This film tells a story of an unlikely friendship between an innocent man Andy Dufrense, sentenced for two murders and a convicted murder, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding. Together they hope to one day become free men and experience life outside the prison walls. This is a film that touches every viewer's heart, a movie that has changed many lives. The Shawshank Redemption is renowned as being a landmark movie by association of the characters, crimes and confessions that played major roles in the film's success. The actors chosen for this film are one of the main reasons as to why this movie was so successful. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play the two leading roles throughout The Shawshank Redemption. As well as a main character throughout the film, Morgan Freeman also narrates a vast quantity of the film. Morgan Freeman won several awards for best actor and best supporting actor for his part in The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, the innocent man wrongly jailed. The two characters become instantly believable from the first time they meet. Red bets 10 cigarettes that Andy will be the first to break, Andy however defies Reds statement. This bond becomes inseparable. The opening scene is of Andy being sentenced in a courtroom, the camera changes between Red in prison and Andy travelling to the prison until the two separate stories collide. The viewers meet Red and his mates and soon become emotionally attached. Together they grow to accept their fate and they battle the daily challenges that prison has to offer. Andy hides the secret that will change everyone's lives, until one night during a storm. Andy escapes from the Shawshank Prison through a hole, he takes the books containing the bank details from the warden. The cinematography excellence that is displayed constantly throughout this film is strongly displayed once Andy has finally escaped. The camera goes from being a low angle that follows Andy through the sludge to a high Angle allowing us to see Andy with his outstretched arms. This is quite possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. Andy makes a new life for himself as Randall Stevenson. The Shawshank Redemption taught us all that there's more than meets the eye in everything we do. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the first movies to have an entire story line based off a successful prison escape. This film exposed what prison is actually like and how prisoners are treated. The Shawshank Redemption also debunked how you were guilty until proved innocent. Frank Darabont rids your imagination of what ifs and replaces it with when. The Shawshank Redemption uses the posters, given to Andy as presents from Red, to cover the hole that would ignite Andy Dufrense big escape. It is once that Andy has wriggled out of his prison cell one night that he finally has the chance to escape. With each clap of thunder, Andy strikes the sewage pipe with a rock until he finally breaks through, he then crawls for 500 yards through sewage. Andy Dufrense escapes the Shawshank prison to live a new life as Randall Stevenson. Although an iconic landmark movie, The Shawshank Redemption did not receive a single Oscar or Golden Globe. The film received 36 award nominations and went on to win 19 of these nominations. This stop motion picture was a box office success, making a profit of over $28 million. Having spent just $25 million of the making of this movie, the overall profit wasn't bad. The responses from this film were overwhelming positive. Many views stated the fact that this was a movie that will never be forgotten. And how although written by Stephen King, it is unlike any of his other cinematic triumphs. Frank Darabont did extraordinary job of replicating Stephen Kings Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The similarities between the book and the movie are defiantly a stand out, however there was one difference that stunned us all. Why did the movie and the book have different titles? Frank Darabont intentionally changed the name of the movie as he believed with the same name as the book, it would turn some people away. This was as a because of Rita Hayworth's name in the title, however Frank Darabont did completely rid the film of Rita. Instead he incorporated it into the film by it being the very poster that hides the hole that Andy escapes from. The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic successful that has changed the film industry. The Shawshank Redemption is an iconic landmark film that has changed cinema forever. The characters, crimes and confessions from this film have changed the way we see daily objects. The actors chosen to partake in their roles did exceptionally well, making the film so successful. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is never going to go out of style. It will forever remain in the forefront of viewers minds."
140,True,"A brilliant story of a man who suffers through hell but perseveres and comes out on top in a world that seems stacked against him. The man is innocent and he knows this. He doesn't forget this. The warden of the prison he is interred in is a brutal character. He drives prisoners to the brink of sanity. Yet the protagonist befriends him and eventually this plays out against him and the protagonist achieves revenge on behalf of all the abused prisoners.The movie is rich in themes. It deals with friendship, suicidal thoughts, protest, abuse and perseverance."
141,True,"THIS is what movies are all about! A magnificent story, first-class actors, a superbly talented director, plus all the necessary attendant and supporting talents including set design, lighting, music, scripting, and all else that is required in the mix to create a masterpiece. Not a moment of the film is wasted, no segment too short or too long: it is all ""just right"". Who would have thought that a story about men in a cruel prison system could be developed into a memorable movie with many marvellous messages. May I single out one of my favourite actors, James Whitmore? I cannot imagine anyone else more suited to the role than he. In fact, the casting in this epic is remarkable: all parts ideally filled with class actors. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, is not one of my screen favourites, but it's impossible to find any fault with him, and somehow he puts his mark on the role and makes it his. Tim Robbins is perfect; each time I see this film, I appreciate his acting more and more. It's so easy to give Shawshank Redemption a TEN. Surely anything less would be an injustice? Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus !"
142,True,"Brooks' release from Shawshank is considered as one of the most brilliant moments in the Visual of Emotions. - Brooks, one of the oldest inmates at Shawshank is led out on parole after 50 years terrified at the prospect of freedom. Now, Pay attention to how the filmmakers visually communicate isolation .................... -In a sequence that ends with the words ""Brooks Was Here"" permanently etched into the very rafters from which he hangs, doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce that this is a sequence about recognition of one's existence in an uncaring world or rather the lack thereof. Now, we've got the music, we've got the heart wrenching voice of narration, we've got James Whitmore's (Brooks) expressive face. But even if you take that all away, Frank Darabont (The Director) and Roger Deakins (The Cinematographer) are still saying something on the screen, and while we love the shot of an absurdly big halfway house room swallowing Brooks up in the Loneliness of too much space. And the shot of him hanging himself from a symbol so immediately obvious. I'm willing to break the rule of not dissecting symbols because films aren't Da Vinci Code ciphers, They're emotional experiences we're looking at. Which strikes his most clever is how Darabont and Deakins managed to make Brooks and us as the audience feel alone in a crowded space. -In a shot he's absolutely boxed in by background actors every single one of them is pointed away from him with their eye lines pointing outwards such that he is compositionally surrounded by their backs. In fact, this visual trope holds true for almost the entire sequence. You can see it when he was about to bump into a car and the man yelling at him in the car is kept off the screen. And established in the quite literal turning point when he left the prison. Another scene from the manager of the supermarket only turns his body towards him to scold Otherwise, It's all backs. And in the bus scene if we rotated the heads of the actors in the background towards Brooks. I mean it's not exactly a pleasant emotion, the actors all have relatively negative expressions but it's certainly not isolating or lonely anymore, we'd go with persecuting and accusatory and with a small edit we've changed this entire feeling of the scene in a single frame which says a whole hell of a lot about how much these little details can matter, we're not even focused on these other actors, you have to point us to an emotion in an instant which isn't always easy to do. In precisely staged images can be evocative of mostly nothing but carefully planned imagery can save volumes simply by something as simple as the way a person is pointed in the background which is exactly why I think Shawshank gets this moment exactly right."
143,True,I have the film on a firestick. Saw it originally at the cinema. Whenever I am depressed and fed up I watch it again I am probably up to 10 times now. A work of genius. The Mozart Nozze de Figaro one of the great scenes. But they are all great scenes. What more is there to say????
144,True,"An unmatched movie. I really missed this kind of movie. The story was excellent. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find such a work. Really surprising story of an ordinary man. When the life changed, people may find themselves different way of struggle. Coping with life change, how a man can find his aim in a different way. Human can fixed his freedom nothing stop him. A very successful scenario. I can say that the actors are indeed perfect.It's impossible to think of the end as you get trapped in the flow of Filmin. The result is really emphatic."
145,True,Very nice movie. I could not find any flaws. I was recommended again and again but I took long to watch The Shawshank Redemption. But later I decided that we all should trust rating giving by movie reviewers. I had seen trailer only and decided to watch the movie. But when I watched it then I said wow. What a movie.
146,True,"Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red. Written by J-S-Golden"
147,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods."
148,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring Samar as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze DI Figaro by Mozart."
149,True,"This film really has the philosophical hat on its head - especially that of Existentialism. It explores beautifully the idea that we make our own meaning in this world, and that being given an essence by others - the prison, jailers, and the satanic warden in this case - really deprives us of basically what makes us human, our ability to make choices. Andy's escape can be seen as a metaphor for the acceptance of existentialism and of making your own choices - using one's radical freedom as Jean Paul Satre would put it. While Red serves as a loose representative of the idea of essentialism. I feel ambivalent about the famous quote from this film which goes, ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" I am not sure I agree. But in my own way, I can see the idea behind it. Hoping is a sure cause for suffering, and mastering that suffering - as Friedrich Nietzsche would say - is the roadway to happiness. The people who can't endure this suffering may not be all that admirable - Red, for instance. It is maybe Andy's endurance and mastering of his suffering that makes him admirable and compelling as a protagonist. The redemption in the title is symbolic of the release of inauthentic and externally imposed meaning, and the act of embracing authentic meaning. In short, this film is one of those films that get you thinking about life; it has all the entertainment, symbolism, and Philosophical depths that you could need to make the most of your time. It's definitely worth it!"
150,True,"Interesting plot to watch. One of movie that capable to make you to buy from Movie Store.The starting of the story is already enough to give impact (even tho it quite slow). However, it change when it reach of its peak. The tone change until it reach climax. As viewer, who already repeats watching for years, i recommend this movie to watch again and again. The starring are awesome, the character are awesome. Worth to watch and buy copy at video store."
151,True,"The film is excellent. From the outset, you penetrate to the main character, because you feel that he is innocent, it is difficult for him to go to jail and for experiencing it. Morgan Freeman acts as a classical sage who helps Andy not fall into the abyss. Escape for now dirty and unpleasant, it is perceived as an attempt to get out of the darkness into the light through the mud and the final purification by the rain is delivered genius."
152,True,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever."
153,True,"I have seen this movie and I am really impressed by both the lead actors Freeman and Tim. One thing that I want to say about this movie is that this movie has the everything that a viewer want to look i.e creativity, emotion, message, feel. I really loved this and this movie deserves this rating."
154,True,Has to be my all time favourite film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both tanlented actors.The plot is so cleverly written and does the novel justice. Stephen King is one of my favourite writers and i hope he's proud with the job Robbins and Freeman did.There's not much more i can actually say that hasn't been said already.
155,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is about a Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy learns to get by in the brutal confines of prison, even earning the respect of his fellow inmates, most notably the long time convict ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). While being an R rated film I didn't feel like it was an R rated film. I mean there were some scenes, other than that it could've been rated a PG-13, but it's not up to me. The Drama/Crime film was surprising on first view but in the best world, I literally watched it straight after I watched for the first time, although it does have a running time of 142 minutes. It was well worth it. I now know some of the most iconic scenes ever in film history, I knew them before but I never understood until I watched it for the first time. I think one of the most touching and in terms of the film itself, one of the biggest scenes was the death of Brookes. I wasn't able to handle it, you know that feeling you get when you're watching a film and you can kind of guess what's about to happen but you don't want it to happen, so you're sat there like no, no, no, no, no, you know? In the film it becomes clear that the prison is corrupt with inside deals and businesses going on, it is also revealed to the audience that the prison does not follow the prison standards of the state and that it does what it wants. Such as, when on the first night Andy is in his cell and all of the other prisoners tell him and are talking about who there is always one who cracks first, it turns out to be a guy only a few cells away from Andy, we then see how the guards deal with the situation in a sarcastic manner and how they blatantly don't care at all, as they proceed to actually club the guy to death. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. . We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space. There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind. Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. If you have not seen this film, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?!!? Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"
156,True,"It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!"
157,True,"Amazing movie.Although my friends and many other people suggested me to watch this movie, it was only after I watched this movie that it became my favorite movie ever. It teaches you that HOPE can get you out of any hell of a situation. The friendship between Andy and Red is another best thing in this movie.The best feel good movie ever made. The friendship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is flawless and inspiring. It gives a beautiful message about not loosing hope even in the toughest of times."
158,True,"Well, not always, but THIS prison is awesome. I've been to real prison in Ireland and England and spent a few months in jail in southern France. Not long terms, mind you but enough to get a good first hand understanding of what life is like behind bars. If I had to be locked up for 20 years I don't think I'd mind being in Shawshank. You make lifelong friends, get a little beatdown action with the guards, drink some tasty cold brews on the roof with your buds, build a library, listen to Italian opera and go to movies with the guys, dig holes for escaping. It's the schit. Shawshank fukken rocks bro. This is possibly the best film I've ever seen. I hope if I ever go back to prison (and chances are good) I hope it's exactly like Shawshank, only I'd want to have some chicks so it would be like a co-ed prison. Maybe a chick warden too. Mmmm. Yummy wild ass prison bictches. Haha bro. I'm actually looking forward to my next incarceration."
159,True,"I have seen this film too many times to count and every time I do I am still just as blown away as the first. Stellar cast, clear storytelling, with a unique perspective. I believe everyone should add this film to their must watch list. The world needs more movies of this quality."
160,True,"I am not a reviewer to write about this movie but i am a huge of the movie. The movie has a feel to it which i cant explain even after seeing it for many times .Still fresh after many watches best movie ever. Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman steal the show with their performances."
161,True,I completely recommend this movie to everyone there is a bit of language but I didn't mind I found the story interesting and moving I liked watching the evolution of Andy throughout the years (I.e. new haircut or outfit) sometimes the movie almost brought me to tears when Brooks couldn't handle being outside of Shawshank. Totally recommend this movie watch it!
162,True,"This film exactly a deep message, I love the story and the feeling. I am watched this film a bit late in 2001, but I love to watch again. Amazing story with and actors.If I know right the film was built on one of Stephen King novelette. It has an incredible powerful positive message that we will always need."
163,True,"The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through."
164,True,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known among st his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood."
165,True,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?"
166,True,"I put the film 10 stars for the following reasons: 1) The ratio of actors to their acting is excellent. 2) The atmosphere at the level. Immerses in a prison gloomy world. 3) Well thought out plot. 4) Lack of interest, while watching the movie, did not appear. 5) Accompanying the film with music on the level. 6) The film did not cause me a negative or disgust, but rather inspired. 7) The film has a deep meaning, you can get it by having certain life beliefs (in my personal opinion). The film is definitely worth a look. For each there is useful information."
167,True,"Just a awesome movie. Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks..."
168,True,"This movie has changed my opinion about life and I believe it will change a lot of people's life. I think everybody must watch this movie. Because they will get to know the difference between guilty and innocent. And they will decide which is important. Innocence, guilt, honesty."
169,True,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
170,True,"Let me just start by saying if you think this movie might not be for you, just watch it. Actually, when I was in the 7th grade my friend and I visited the Mansfield Reformatory (just because we wanted to see if it was haunted) unknowing my soon to be favorite movie was filmed there. Fast forward a year and everything I had heard on our tour of the Mansfield Reformatory about how awesome Shawshank Redemption was, I finally found out.The movie is not something I would typically watch but the story is just incredible. Andy, one of the main actors is a banker and sentenced for the supposed ""murder"" of his wife. Andy goes through for lack of better terms complete hell until he finds his place within the prison and plans to escape because he is truly innocent. Throughout Andy's journey in the prison, you feel as if you are stuck there with him. His frustrations are your frustrations and you wish you could prove his innocence. Through various factors such as sound, lighting, the location (Mansfield Reformatory), and actors have you glued to the screen seeing if Andy can escape. I won't give too much more away for this amazing film but please just watch it, I promise you will not be disappointed."
171,True,The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie so blah this hen mom the Stephan King ugh ghost really good movie you should watch it Morgan Freeman is in it and its a good movie i don't know what I'm doing you already know what this movie is and this wont help you just go see I'm just writing this because i need to write a first review
172,True,"Rich content of this layered masterpiece with perfect time line will bring you to the prison life of 50s. Personally, I consider The Shawshank Redemption best adaptation of Kings novel ever. Superb cast of Robbins and Freeman under the leadership of Frank Darabont gave us cult classic. This movie is on my top 10 movies ever list. Further, I find this movie my view changing movie as I was deprived of personal unjustifiable hate to Crime genre. A movie worth admiring"
173,True,"The Shawshank Redemption will keep you on the edge of your seat. We journey with the main character as he finds his way around his new home in prison. There are many lessons learned but we see a small light at the end of the tunnel. If you enjoy true cinema, you will enjoy this story."

175,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare films, where you can tell from the opening credits, the first chords of the soundtrack and the first voice-over line from Morgan Freeman, that you're about to witness a movie of exceptional quality. It's Beautiful, Moving and has an Amazing score."
176,True,"One of the best movies i have seen till date,I did not see it till 2015 and always wondered whats's so special about this movie that it's sitting there at the top of the IMDb list and hasn't'been dethroned since ages? I finally decided it was about time i find it out and holy moly,it totally deserves that spot up top and i don't think there will ever be a movie which comes to a s close as this."
177,True,"The story may sound simple, but the truth behind the words is remarkable. When I heard the name of the film first time, I considered the Shawshank to be a man' name, but in fact it is a jail's namea hell in the world. Not only for the inhumanity of the prisonthey behaved brutally; but also for the jail gnawed at people' heart by keeping them waiting and waiting as life passed. It seemed that only those utterly worthless people who gave up everything could survive. That's where the story happened. The part impressed me most is when Andy got out of the jail. He extended his arms in front of him in the heavy rain as if he were welcoming the fresh air and the freedom. At that moment, I saw the confidence win the darkness, discharging light dazzling the eyes in the dark blue sky. Under the light, I could feel my recreant heart being shivering as his voice said: ""Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies!"" That's why I like this film: it encourages people to fight to preserve the dignity of human beings, to appreciate the beauty of life, and the most importance is to keep hope forever. He once that is born, that is die. Everyone is the same. The only difference is whether busy living or busy dying. The film tells us that even a man can live once, but if he keeps confidence, keeps hope and works his life right, then once is enough. The freedom is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark, the hope is the chief happiness that this world affords, and the life should be full of the singing of the bird and the happiness hope brings. ＂ What's that do you think? It's the trembling of the heart, the singing of the mind, the flying of the soul and the hope to be free."""
178,True,"This is one incredible film. I like the way he goes into to jail all sweet and innocent, then a few months later he is running the show haha. its so clever how he tunneled out of the prison and used the poster to hide his work. if you want a great film to watch, i really highly recommend this one."
179,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes close to sounding one of those human victory. But most of it is conserved. It is assisted greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a up-lifter named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two."
180,True,one of the best movies i have ever watched! 10/10 would watch again. the subtle details and beautiful cinematography! it was very well calculated and the ending was the right amount of vague. the best scene has to be when he is escaping from shawshank and he has to time his strikes with the rock on the pipe with the lightning so he wont make any noise. amazing movie!
181,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is continuously moving forward; a stream of characters and narrative arcs are put into the foreground for around 20 minutes each, in each of these, a different aspect of prison life is conveyed, and occasionally, the tone is entirely different from the previous one; despite this, the film avoids feeling anthology-like with a consistent setting.Shawshank Prison feels living and breathing from the moment it first appears on the screen; via the forever-moving background characters, and the varied environments inside and outside of the prison! Shawshank itself is one of the most interesting things about this film, and quite possibly why it appeals to so many people; prison is an inherently interesting location to set a film; much like a school or workplace setting; there is a sense of order: people's routines are controlled by people above them - Shawshank combines the relatability of this with the crime and drama of a courtroom or heist film.Please have a nice day, and enjoy the film!"
182,True,"A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie"
183,True,"Shawshank was a brilliant story that had every right to be retold on the silver screen. Its main theme is corruption, which I often find myself enjoying. Corruption is a slow process, but it's very impactful once you notice it's happening. I love subtle changes like that. The moment of realization for me was Tommy's death. Looking back on it now, there were plenty of tells that the warden was abusing his power, even before this scene. But like I said, power corrupts slowly. So slowly, you don't even notice it happening until something drastic happens, and this movie perfectly captured that concept! Props to Stephen King for creating such a well-thought-out story!"
184,True,"The experience of a hot-shot banker named Andrew Dufresne played by Tim Robbins. After being sentenced to 2 life terms for the killing of his wife and her lover, Andy then finds himself to be an inmate at the Shawshank prison. For a crime, he swears he didn't commit. The movie is centered around Andy's journey as an inmate in the prison, the brutal beatings and harassments, and changes he experiences. Where Andy meets another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman, mistakenly picks him as the new prisoner that will most likely crack under the pressures of prison. After the beating and killing of one of the new inmates (fishes) Andy still does not break. Reds ability to obtain wanted objects helps establish a friendship between him and Red. This friendship leads to many prison adventures and later events help him and he gains respect from his friends, staff, and the warden.Motifs displayed in the film are Corruption and crime. The idea of the prison should be the rehabilitation of men. However, instead the prison is focuses and praises corruption, greed, and money laundering. Andy's quick willingness to launder money for the Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton showed his survival skills and need to protect himself. The editors use of voice-overs and flash backs sets the scenes for viewers allowing them to be able to see the events of the prison.My thematic ideas of the film are Isolation and imprisonment, which seems to be a large focus of the film. The bars, strict schedules, horrible guards are just some of the reason for isolation. The film shows a lot of people taking advantage of the system for their own gain, from Red, who smuggles anything into the prison. All the way to the Warden, who benefits from forced prison labor and money laundering. However, the power of hope is Andy's main driver throughout his experience in prison. Andy attempts to maintain his self-worth and idea of getting out one day. Tunneling his way through the concrete cell wall. Hope is all that Andy has left."
185,True,The Shawshank Redemption Is a movie in which the main character Andy ends up in jail. While in jail he suffer many hardships such as assaults etc. However he also makes some wonderful life friends and his soul mate portrayed by the excellent Martin Freeman who eventually helps Andy escape from Azkaban. This is one of the greatest movies ever defiantly worth a watch.
186,True,One of inspiring movie of all time every one should watch it. times I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch.
187,True,"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison, and commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy declines to continue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine, and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.The next day at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. FBI agents arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid his arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."
188,True,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shaw shank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."
189,True,"i'm grateful for this movie , because the feeling after i finished it was a new feeling , its more then satisfying. the movie show you what happens if you never give up and how to enjoy living your live even in the worst Circumstances. the actors were perfect. there is nothing to say people didn't say it,shortly The Shawshank Redemption deserve to be in top ten best movies."
190,True,"I have seen this movie since childhood, it gives me so much emotion, I love all the people in the movie, and the movie changes think of people. It talk about We have the right to life, freedom and rights. Longing for happiness, thanks to the film, director, and actor, a truly excellent film."
191,True,"In My Opinion The Shawshank Redemption Is The Greatest Movie Ever Made. Now You Might Disagree And Say That That Movies Like Citizen Kane, The Godfather Parts 1&2 Or Casablanca Are Better Movies But While They Are Great Movies I Wasn't As Emotionally Invested In The Story Or The Characters Nearly As Much As I Was With Andy Dufresne's Struggle Of Freedom.Now The Story Of The Shawshank Redemption Follows Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robins ) A Former Bank Merchant Convicted Of The Murder Of His Wife And Her Secret Lover And Is Imprisoned In Shawshank Prison. While There He Meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) Over Time Andy Learns To Live With His Past Haunting Him. Full Of Corruption Andy Attempts To Uncover The Truth Of What Is Happening In Shawshank Prison While At The Same Time Planning His Escape From It. The Shawshank Redemption Is Full Of Stunning Performances Including Tim Robins Quiet Portrayal As Andy Dufresne And Morgan Freeman's Oscar Nominated Performance As Red. Now O Love Watching Classic Movies But No Scenes Strike Me As Emotionally As Red Moving In To The Same Apartment As Where Brooke Hung Himself And Saying To Himself I Just Have To Face It I'm Not Going To Make It On The Outside And Andy Dufresne Realising That In Life There's Only Two Choices You Can Either Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Dying. Now This Just My Opinion But I Think That The Shawshank Redemption Should Have Won Best Picture At The 1995 Oscars Because While I Enjoy Forrest Gump I Do Find It Is A Bit Cliché And A Bit Overrated. If You Have Not Seen The Shawshank Redemption Yet I Highly Suggest You Get Find It And Watch I Promise You Will Enjoy It. I Give The Shawshank Redemption A 10 / 10"
192,True,"A beat of throwing up, main character Andy, brought to life by actor Tim Robbins, takes another zip of Whiskey from the imaginary Rosewood brand. The year 1947, the location New England, Maine, United States of America. No titles over the picture necessary. A long and steady dolly-out shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins alongside a parked vintage car's driver door opens ""The Shawshank Redemption"" accompanied with a muffled radio song, setting the tone for music arranged by composer Thomas Newman. Voice-Over send out from a court room hearing in which Andy stands trail for murdering his wife and her lover at a golf country club. A Flashback scene between the two lovers is used by Director Frank Darabont to visualize Andy's broken heart. A life in shattered glass. Andy states the divorce with his wife should have taking place in Reno, Nevada. A long way from home to break off a life-long matrimony, covering the entire country in subconscious mind of the spectator. A prosecuting lawyer counter-strikes ""I see you in hell before I sign the divorce paper"". Andy comprehends himself that he has been upset by the betrayal. An anonymous jury unimpressed by the cold-hearten and calculated man; sending Andy to a back-to-back life sentence in an institution nearby where all familiar book of books is king.""No sir, I learned my lesson, I'm a changed man,"" contemplates the character of Red, performed by 50 years plus Morgan Freeman, in a 16-year-old teenage boy manner, having already 20 years of prison time on his shoulders. A red-colored stamp went down on paper; rejected. Out of the dark, out of a cellar embedded in iron railings and gray concrete walls, Red walks into an open yard, regaining a throne, organizing his kingdom in dealing pleasure items to inmates. New inmates, the fresh fish; the bets are on, who is to break, who is to gain momentum. Regular sears and ravings fill a soundtrack enriched by classical score. We are flying over the walls of Shawshank prison with a helicopter before getting dragged over ground through a main gate into darkness, becoming animals in a pit. Armed surveillance mandatory in a world, where no blasphemy has a chance. ""You put your faith in the book of books and serve the lord"", the prison's warden, personalizes by actor Bob Gunton, leaves no doubts that he owns the human condition in a realm of dreamy escapology.Steaming water vapor in a laundry kitchen connects on the page, adapted from a short novel by Stephen King, as Red keeps dealing in a system of wrapped-cotton logistics. Andy gets his rock-hammer for a price. No freebies. Cigarettes are welcome as valid currency. A sisters gang out for testosterone safaris, ""They've to be human first, to be homosexual"", says Red for-seeing Andy's routine. Two years of choosing beatings over rape. Time won't wait. Roofing in springtime 1949, where beer-drinking in a setting sun becomes exemptions to Andy's character of missed out breath-works and selflessness. Closer to the edge of falling and shining with knowledge of an educated man, conquering a reign of violence by stating dialogue over money savings for head guard, played by Clancy Brown, who's character's marriage gets communicated as the state to be to secure an existence. Projection of old movies in black and white, the swaying of Hollywood star that transcends teenage wet dreams. Themes of revenge seem to breath the walls of solitary imprisonment, punishments of the hole. Reference of fairness in an unfair world, where guards avenge inmates, the new maxim of an human order where the personal benefit leads the rapture and hot spot cinematography, sharing creative grounds from Roger Deakins to Robert Richardson, for a personal talk between the Warden and Andy.The prison as microcosm for a life in chains. Growth with assignments taking on, Andy finishes project of building a library of novelty, music and art. The picture idealized prison time as profession, where one can work for living as everywhere. ""Outside the walls I have been clean as a whistle, inside the walls you learn to be a crook"" states Andy for which receives the obligatory punishment by presenting his innocence of murder to the Warden, not for-seeing that it has been too late to take sides. The living as a neutron learns the character the hard way by getting a two months solitary stretch in Shawshank's dungeon. Corridor of solitary cells captured in far side depth of field foreshadowing first ingredients towards Frank Darabont's succeeding project ""The Green Mile"" (1999).Melancholy and sentiment fill ""The Shawshank Redemption"" towards the Director's clean out come in order to present an Happy End Picture. The Warden shoots himself after being exposed to fraud and murder. Red lets go off it all in a following revision meeting protesting to evaluating supervisor, ""You stamp your form sonny, because I do not give a damn"". He pushes out the prison gate after more than 30 years as inmate, where John Ford's ""The Searchers"" (1956) presents the open range of mystical horizon to actor John Wayne, there Frank Darabont stays true to his realism transcending in collaboration with Morgan Freeman the gray of an asphalt jungle. By then Andy has escaped prison, liquidated all bank accounts, being exposed as focused war horse, digging a tunnel for 19 years with the 7 inch rock hammer despite any humiliation, leaving Red the mysteries of the world buried in earth under an weeping willow tree on a forest clearing at city named Buxton.

193,True,Must see. Great movie with an unexpected ending. I have seen it so many times. One of the best prison-based movies in history. Great performance by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I recommend this film to everyone and it does age better than most films. I haven't met anyone yet that doesn't appreciate this one.
194,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie which is hypnotising in just how good it is.You know the type of film; whenever it's on TV (which in this case it constantly is) you have to stop what you're doing and watch it - one of those rare movies in which you don't want to end. With the all the movies out there in which you find yourself checking how long is left of the running time, here is one in which you see there is a whole hour left and you're glad; the mark of a truly great movie.Carcerophobia is the fear of going to prison and is something which has crossed my mind in the past, partially brought on by movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Even if you've committed nothing illegal like Andy Dufresne, there is always that possibility that an honest law abiding citizen could end up in the slammer. The world of Shawshank State Penitentiary is one with little to no human rights, one with shocking but believable treatment from both the guards and fellow prisoners as they engage in brutal, sadistic acts. Regardless of what prisons around the world are like circa 2017, your ""whole life (is) blown away in the blink of an eye, nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"". The Shawshank Redemption may be one of Stephen King's non horror works, but the prospect of going to prison for a crime you never committed gets under my skin.One of the aspects of The Shawshank Redemption which intrigues me the most in the empire Andy builds while inside prison as well as an insight of the economics and commerce which goes on between the prisoners and guards. Just like Robert Stroud in Birdman of Alcatraz, he is still able to find meaning in his life despite being in what first looks like a hopeless situation; he is able to find hope in despair. This really does show that at the end of the day, knowledge is power. Likewise Andy sending a letter every week to the state government for prison library funding and ultimately playing with the system, always something which inspires me.What makes Andy Dufresne such a great character? Like Tim Robbins himself, there is more than meets the eye. Robins has an intelligence to him and you can't quite figure out what is going on behind his eyes, an actor with a mysterious aura to him and this comes through with the character of Andy. He is not like the rest of the prisoners, he's a civilised gentleman thrown into the jungle that is prison but he's not a sheltered fool ether and knows how to deal with his new surroundings. But why do I need to tell you this, the narration sums up his character perfectly in a beautiful and poetic manner - ""I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over."" Likewise I also find myself very intrigued by the character of Brooks; just how does such a gentle soul end up in prison? Did he really commit a crime? Who knows?Morgan Freeman has the ability to play wise old men without coming off as a stereotype or a cliché. His narration is describing what obviously appears in the film, so what makes it so great? Like the best film narration it's to do with its poetic manner and the way in which it's delivered; scenes in the film were shot to time with the pre- recorded voice over plus it goes without saying Freeman has one of the most heavenly voices ever. None of his dialogue is necessary for the advancement of the plot, yet what would the film be without it? There are just so many inspirational quotes.The escape sequence itself so incredible yet at the same time is entirely believable and one of the most satisfying movie revenge plots. Many people always point out as to how Andy could reattach the poster to the wall when he begins his escape through the tunnel, even Frank Darabont acknowledges this on the DVD audio commentary although I am puzzled as to why this is made into a big deal. Andy could simply attach the poster to the wall at the top two corners and allow gravity to cover the remainder of the hole and simply crawl into it from below as if the poster where a curtain, likewise we never see on screen if the poster has been reattached on all four corners.When I think of films which can convey an expansive range of powerful human emotions and feelings and act as a form of emotional therapy a few instantly come to my mind - It's a Wonderful Life, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. Films which help one to break from the mental prisons of our life."
195,True,"The Shawshank Redemption A literary/movie reviewIt is often said that a book should not be judged by its movie; based/adapted on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption the movie The Shawshank Redemption tries to oppose this claim. Frank Darabont, the director of the movie penned the screenplay to perfection (near about!) , having acquired the filming rights from his pen-pal Stephen King. Albeit He made some changes in the screenplay from the novella , these changes make the movie more watchable! Lets say Frank took some cinematic liberty which even bettered the movie from the novella. The strong voice of Morgan Freeman narrates the movie sequences for us. The character of Freeman is an Irish (Ellis Boyd Rankine ;called as Red in the movie whole time) in novella and Frank alludes to this fact when Freeman tells Andy Dufresne, ""maybe because I'm an Irish."" The story is obviously inspired from Leo Tolstoy 's story ""God sees the truth, but waits."" (Andy is wrongly? accused of murdering)The film also refers to Alexandre Dumas's ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" . Actually this scene is quite comic and funny. Heywood , a fellow convict of Dufresne's reads wrongly the name of Alexandre Dumas name as dumb-ass, then Andy corrects him and tells him that the book will interest Heywood that the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is also about Prison break and Red (Freeman) says jokingly that the this book should also be put under Educational pile of books. Both the book and movie tells us about a smart banker (Dufresne) who is wrongly convicted through fate for the murder of his wife and her lover in cold blood. In the mid-way of novella and the movie We are told that there might be a possibility of acquitting , but while novella disperses this possibility gently , the film does something quite different and shocking, Another cinematic liberty!! Then the through the Banker or Red , we are acquainted with the hardships and cruel practices ongoing in the Shawshank Prison. How Andy Dufresne copes with the Prison environment and find new ways of amusement as in listening to opera, setting up of huge library and teaching fellow prison members. Of course his journey is not a smooth one. A major difference in physique of Andy is depicted in the movie from the novella,where Tim Robbins is Tall and strapping , Andy in the book is average height and of weak physique which makes him prone to attack of sodomites and how he fights them back. Both book and movie make us realize the price of freedom, hope and endless patience and perseverance. Andy picks up a curious habit which he used to pursue when he was free in his home which helps him a lot as we move through. Then movie shows the usual and Cruel! Prison officers and wardens, their scheming and corruption. How Andy fights them and overwhelms them is a study and pleasure to watch or read whichever you choose. P.S.-Rita Hayworth is Chekhov's Gun in both movie and novella!!!! Quotable Quotes- ""Get busy living or Get Busy Dying"""
196,True,No spoilers ahead.Certainly one of the best movies ever made.I first watched this movie three weeks ago. I liked this movie so much that I watched it around three more times despite my busy schedule.Here are some things to watch out for in the movie.1- Plot: The plot is fabulous. It is filled with surprises every now and then. The plot would certainly hold you on your seat.2- Dialogues: The dialogues are too good. This movie is one of the very few movies with inspiring dialogues. Some of the dialogues will be remembered forever.3- Direction: The direction of the movie conveys emotions very well. While watching this movie you would certainly become a part of Shawshank prison.
197,True,this movie is great because i watched it so many times.couldn't get enough of this movie thats how great it is. you should really watch it because if you like action movies this will be your type of movie..so please go check it out because its super awesome i'm a actor so i know you guys will like it be sure to check it out you guys wont regret it i promise you... so please check it out
198,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."
199,True,"I only regret one thing, I didn't see this movie on a large screen in '95. Everything is perfect, Freeman and Robbins are perfect in their roles, and even Bob Gunton in the role of master and Clancy Brown as captain Harley who both hate (the captain still looks sympathetic when he beats Bogs but the master is more than detestable). We find in this film the injustice in its pure state with Andy Dufresne twice sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders he says he didn't commit, and that he didn't commit and who is making friends with a resident who has been there for 20 years, Red, known for being ""the man who gets everything"". The ultimate injustice falls when Tommy, a ""little asshole"" who took two years for burglary, learns to Andy that a man killed his wife and her lover of, an opportunity for Andy to prove that he is not guilty. When the director asks Tommy if it is true and young man says ""yes"", he killed Tommy to protect his interests. However, Dufresne happens to escape from prison and takes all the money he had laundered for the master and he go live in Mexico after he denounced Norton, forcing him to commit suicide. This film shows us a great friendship between Freeman and Robbins but it also raises the problem of reintegration, showing us Brooks, detained for 50 years in Shawshank, not surviving the outside world and committing suicide. This film is perfect, music could be the weak point but I would just say that's not a strong point, which does not prevent the fact that this film is a masterpiece worth a 10/10!

202,True,"Contains Spoiler. Well it has been number one for years for only one reason. It's simple, predictable, yet so amazing and gripping. Story revolves around imprisoned guy and his life in jail to the end, what ever it might be. Step by step his downfall, making friends with another inmate. Unlike any other prison story or stories about prison break it is something more and becomes complicated with successive watching."
203,True,"This movie is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie keeps you engaged and guessing the whole time, which is what makes a movie good. The actors are perfect when working together and give the story better meaning. I have seen the movie so many times and am currently about to watch it again. 10/10"

And Acting it's wonderful actor and actress. Sound it also so good animation good.Me and my friends when watched this movies so we were very happy.
206,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is the first film of Frank Darabont and the best movie of all times, undoubtedly.Based in the short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption' of Stephen King (the master of terror), this adaptation is the most realistic story about the hard reality in the prisons and an excellent reflect of our daily life (fear, hope, routine, justice, ambition, freedom and so on).There are many interesting and endearing characters in the story; however, I only can mention the main characters, they are: - Andy Dufresne: the main character, a man condemned to two life imprisonments for an error, however he is the most optimistic and intelligent character. - Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding: the narrator, the best friend of Andy and the person who get anything for the prisoners. - Samuel Norton: the ambitious warden of Shawshank prison and the main antagonist. - Brooks Hatlen: the old man that takes care of the library in the prison and the institutionalize man that must confront his hard reality.In the story, we can watch the main ideas of the stoic and existentialist philosophy, especially the last ideology such we can see in the Andy's actions because he looks for his liberty and he makes his destiny. For more information, anybody we can see the next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XDnA9z8h0.Like in Mulholland Drive, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth has a great importance along of story because Andy have a poster of Rita Hayworth, he and 'Red' watch her film 'Gilda', and Stephen King uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of hope.This film we can divide in nine parts: - The Andy's judgment: Andy is condemned to two life imprisonments. - The first two years: Andy must confront many problems in the prison, especially Bogs. - The ascent of Andy: Andy helps to prisoners, guardians and the warden. - The destiny of Brooks Hatlen: After 50 years in prison, Brooks leaves prison but he must face the new world. - The prison's library: Andy builds a better library in the Shawshank prison. - The Tommy's story: Andy decides to help Tommy, a new prisoner, and he will help to Andy. - The descent of Andy: Andy have problems with the warden so all needs hope. - Andy gets his freedom: Andy gets his liberty and 'Red' tell us how he did it. - 'Red' gets his freedom: 'Red' gets his liberty but he must fulfill a promise. However, the story is very fluid, so anybody could enjoy the story in all moment.The most powerful scene in the film is when finally Andy gets his freedom and he celebrates in the rain, because it represents the triumph of hope after many years, furthermore the soundtrack is excellent in that moment.Along of film, there are important sentences that invite to reflecting: - Get busy living, or get busy dying. - Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. - Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free (This sentence not appears in the film, but it is important for explain the story).This film is the best and more people must know this masterpiece of the cinema story."
207,True,"Amazing movie. The actors are great and dialogues are incredible. Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner. This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories."
208,True,"Best movie It is definitely worthy of its number one spot for so many years. I am never bored of re watching it The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently."
209,True,"This was a great movie!!!I enjoyed it. 10/10. I never seen this movie before and now that I finally had the chance to see it, I'm about to sit back and watch this movie over and over again. I hope my movie gets good reviews like this movie did! Actually, Im about to re-watch this movie because I'm really impressed. Time to make some popcorn and get my soda again."
210,True,"Well the movie was great and I did enjoy watching this movie and moreover, this movie has all the plus points and I would like to say thanks to the directors and the role players for making a great movie. Thank you. May God bless you all and may God make it easier for you God will."
211,True,an extraordinary performance of Morgan Freeman when i watched the movie first time surprised with the story line and making. fantastic wonder super movie. we can understand what is the use of patience. nearly i saw the movie 5 times Morgan freeman's wonderful acting melting us. few little movies only impact us this shawshank redemption is one of that.
212,True,"Redemption has many meanings depending on the point of view. But Joining friendship, determination, sense of justice, hope, patience, Goals and purposes, all packed in a dream, and freedom, is not Any redemption. It is the fulfillment in life. Learn the value and gift that Freedom represents when it is achieved by mixing these Ingredients all. The film is simply a must-see!"
213,True,"excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This one my favorite!!!!!!!!!! Just love this story. Ready to review a million times. And still will be the best. The film makes you experience everything on yourself. You will love it! I do not even know how I put it on, I'm in a situation like this."
214,True,"Yeah so I gave it a 7, and it was better then average but wasn't amazing. I think it was meant to have some ulterior meaning or some deep philosophical meaning that those who watch it are meant to sit and think about. But meh. It was okay, some guy kills his wife, goes to jail and escapes. I didn't hate it but was it the most gripping story ever - no. The acting was good I guess but frankly it wasn't that exciting and I forced myself to finish it because it's meant to be a classic. At least the ending wasn't as bad a Citizen Kane."
215,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne ""Tim Robbins"", the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding Morgan Freeman. It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy ""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over"", and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."
216,True,"It's amazing that such an ""old"" movie without the theatrical super effect that we see nowadays in any action movie, is still holding strong in its reviews and critics. There is only one reason for this: SUPERB ACTING!!! While Tim Robbins appears to be the main characters and leading man, the show is being stolen again and again by Morgan Freeman. But they do complement each other so much that I could not envision this movie without both of them in their respective roles. The rest of the cast, come and go throughout the movies and bring additional drama, emotions and a greater sense of what life could be in prison, either if you are the prisoner or guard. Of course there are parts of the movie that are a bit ""far-fetched"", but you know you are watching a movie, not a real-life drama so it's easily forgiven as it brings deeper enrichment to the movie.SPOILER ALERT: My best scene is when Red (Morgan Freeman) is getting the envelope that Andy (Tim Robbins) left him by the Oak Tree. He scans around to ensure that he is not being watched and he opens the envelope very carefully, while continuing to look around to ensure no one is watching him. What an amazing actor to be able to portrait that sense of distrust of everything, after spending so much time in prison where it becomes a fact of life to always ""look over your shoulder"". I'm always in awe of his acting whenever I come upon this scene. I have seen this movie way back in 1994...and probably at least 10 more times since then...and whenever I flick channels on the TV ( in the odd time I watch ""real"" TV) and see Shawshank Redemption playing...I just can't stop myself to watch it again!"
217,True,"Great Acting, Great Storyline, Great Graphics, Great Sound, One of the Best Movies of All Time, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-see movie for anyone who likes and enjoys movies. Through all the twists of the story and all the moments you won't expect there is an ending that is one of the most gratifying in cinema history and will fulfill any viewer."
218,True,"One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances.Just perfect."
219,True,"I think that in this film everything is executed to the highest degree genius. Every frame of the film, this is a masterpiece. There would be an opportunity to put this film 20 balls. I would not have thought of putting it. The actors play is brilliant. Everything is perfectly beautiful. And the tortures of prison life are conveyed as thinly as possible."
220,True,This movie is really great. I give my highest recommendations to all that wants to watch a great movie. In the movie we see some of the best actors and they really show what they are made of. The movie is based on the book (with the same title). I have not read the book yet - but i intend to do this soon. it was obvious to me that this movie won 7 Oscars after watching it. Best. Casper Ravn-Sorensen
221,True,"Tender, funny, and inspirational, The Shawshank Redemption is a well- crafted prison drama and another great movie to add to Frank Darabont's impressive filmography. Morgan Freeman is the standout as one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, while Tim Robbins and a host of excellent character actors fill out an outstanding ensemble cast that makes you feel like you are there with them in that prison. This is an emotionally satisfying film with many memorable character moments sprinkled into an otherwise pretty standard plot. While I find it to be a little too sensitive at times, this is an excellent motion picture and a must see."
222,True,it is actually good i watched when i was a little boy but i can remember whatever this film is so impressed me and i loved it so much sorry my English by he way English is my second language. i know this film but you know never say never right? actually i am crazy and i have no idea what i am talking about
223,True,"This high budget adaptation of Stephen King's original novel, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, goes like this, a man named Andy Durfresne who is played by Tim Robbins is accused of murdering his wife, therefore he is sentenced to spend 2 life sentences in prison at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. He eventually meets and befriends a black prisoner named Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is played by Morgan Freeman is willing to help Andy deal with the downsides of being behind bars. The strength the film is the acting, you feel the emotion coming from every character, you don't feel the actors playing them, you just feel the actual characters themselves, ranging from Morgan Freeman, to Clancy Brown as Captain Hadley, and Tim Robbins. Freeman's best moments are when he's having conversations with Robbins and narrating throughout most of the film. Brown's character is a very unlikable jerk seeing that he, the other guards, and the warden treat the prisoners like animals but that's his job and he does it well. But of course we can't forget Robbins' outstanding likability, the absolute best scene in the entire film is when he breaks out of prison, stands on his knees in the river, holds his hands in the air, and praises God for his freedom, where you feel how thankful he is to finally be free. If that's not enough then I say SEE IT NOW, because it is the overall best film in history not just for those following reasons."
224,True,"Story of a man that over comes some challenges that would probably kill the normal man, or at the very least break him. Wife murdered, convicted of crime he did not commit, wrongfully imprisoned. From crooked guards to corrupt warden he out smarts them all even his friend. This man never gives up. Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying."
225,True,"In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance's and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature."
226,True,Watched this movie a year n half ago still the scenes from this movie flashes in my mind every now n the whenever any person talks about the last movie they've watched n claims that to be their best movie n then I recommend this very movie. Epic Legendary n one of its kind I bet no other actors other than Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman would have done justice to the roles
227,True,Beautiful movie that hope alive in the audience. A person who escaped from prison after 20 years. Well the main characters. Good complementary character. Morgan Freeman was unsurpassed.Be sure to watch the sky.Certainly not sorry to see him.Rank 1 deserve this movie. best movie IMDb. Thanks for read my review.
228,True,"A very beautiful movie '' revenge is a dish eaten cold '' with the tyrants, not with the tyrants, but with the wisdom will win the battle. As always, the Morgan freeman has again wondered. Human beings go there if they are forced to say what they are going to do and go there and act and behave like that and they say it is right. ""There is no right or wrong. There are some pooch ideas. You can act differently from the community. In this case, you are in power and you are always one step ahead of the others when the struggle starts. Justice may not always be fair. It's a very good movie, but I can not say that you deserve # 1."
229,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see. The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
230,True,"Is this movie the best film in the world? Of course not. But choosing the best film is not that easy. Should it be a movie that was both old and western like The Good the Bad and the Ugly, a mafia movie like the godfather and sometimes boring like the Godfather or a movie that could not understand everyone's issues like Pulp Fiction? Or a superhero movie like Dark Knight? These movies are not movies that everyone will like and understand. But The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that most people can easily watch and impress. So it is unwarranted to discuss it.That's why I think you have such a high score.But in the end it's a good movie.Andy Dufresne had breakfast every morning for 20 years, tackled the job he was given, killing time with his shirt and sleeping in his cell - if he did not have an extraordinary job per day. Looking at this picture, how many brave can be found that the general lines of their lives are much different? A little bigger, but do we live in a big, reinforced concrete jail? Do we spare time because we are forced to do things that are not really relevant to our existence? Do we spend time with friends in the times that we can increase, protect ourselves against madness, and then go to sleep in a dark room? But this funky banker has a difference from our lot. Although he tried to live in accordance with the conditions he knew he could not change from his first day in prison, he never allowed his voice to be silent. He reminded himself of the fact that some of them were not convicted and worked for a world in which he set the conditions in the darkness of the darkness, in the moments when no one knew, Full 20 years! The pressures he saw were not enough to change the reality. Somewhere outside, he never forgot that life is so cold and unstable, there is a little paradise where the soul can turn its inspiration into reality.People can experience various troubles during their lifetime and can live in unhappiness for hundreds of days in a row. But remember that there is always a chance of happiness tomorrow. If you see this as a rabbit-carrot deception, it is known that maybe you are a rabbit, but the stick that the carrot is hanging is also in your hand. It is the wound that personally gives you the will. If you live in a reality illusion, you are entitled to change the direction of your precious life as long as you are breathing away.Andy Dufresne can also remind us that if the anticipation of a life that has spent almost an entire life in captivity can be reminiscent of the freedom of friend red just writing ""red was here"" once and reading it by somebody in the future. I would even go further; You are refused.The more freed you are when you are born, the more freed you are when you die. What you need to do is to fill your life with the colors of your own soul as much as possible during the period between birth and death.Here is a picture you need to remember, for all these reasons, when you find yourself struggling and looking at the walls of the house. If Shawshank Redemption is not inspiring, what is inspiring, I do not know."

232,True,spoiler One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. . If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once. who can ever forget the scene under rain giving freedom a big big hug :)
233,True,I think u will never find a Movie Like Shawshank its amazing Legendary Good Scenario Good Actor Good Every Thing You loosed your Live if you Didn't Watch it. Once When i started To watch This Movie i expect i will see bad Movie but i saw one of The Best or The Best Ever I watched you will enjoy To Watch .

234,True,"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, and although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."
235,True,"This is definitely one of my favorite movies. The story-line was captivating, and unpredictable. I watch it every time any network airs it.The best part about the film is that the actors are very believable. You feel as if you know each and every character personally. There is not a dull moment, and they get right to the plot. There is never a time where you are twirling your thumbs waiting for something interesting to happen. Two thumbs up!"
236,True,"One of the most inspirational and powerful films I have ever watched. While The Shawshank Redemption didn't make it big in the box office, it definitely made a lasting impact in the hearts of many people, including myself. Hope, friendship and love are all themes that tie into the plot of this movie, and it will leave you on the edge of your seat up until the very end. This film will touch your mind, heart and soul, and the actors do a wonderful job of not only becoming an embodiment of their characters but also create and maintain memorable impressions. This film challenges people's perceptions of others as well as themselves and serves to demonstrate that life teaches people to make good use of time while time teaches people the value of life. A timeless and touching film that should be treasured for a lifetime."
237,True,This is an amazing movie that everyone should see at least once in their life! This beautiful movie with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just spectacular. Watching Andy change the prison and the lives of the prisoners inside makes your heart twinge. The humor and heart in this movie is really what makes it great!
238,True,"One of my absolute all-time favorites, a must!""I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.""""I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.""^^^ Both awesome quotes!"
239,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.

Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy Yaşamak' or get busy Dine'."""
240,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I've ever watched without any discussion. I went to check it out to find out why is it on the top of IMDb's list and has the highest ratings. A masterpiece, heartbreaking and filled with divinity. Provides hope and leads person to fight in life.Many times we feel like as if we were deceived and punished, and we did not deserve any of that. And I am not talking about crime and prisons, I am talking about everyday, the small things and injustice that makes us feel bad. What can we do in that kind of situations? We can run away, scream, or even have revenge... But we can do what Andy did in this movie, we can fight and show everyone we are better than them.This is the primary message I got out of this film, all those others about friendship and loyalty are secondary. Also, for me in this film, it is extremely important that God has done justice and reward those who have really been on his side, and punished those fake believers."
241,True,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
242,True,"This is a Hollywood Masterpiece. Undoubtedly the greatest film of all time. Flawless and perfectly acted. If you haven't seen this one ""Watch it immediately""The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.Although the film was a box office disappointment, it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"""
243,True,"Basically, the movie is fantastic. The story is very good and the ending is really meaningful. So are the dialogues and the acting. The story flows slowly. That might be a setback. I really liked the way the prisoners led their lives. The scene on the roof, where they all enjoy was the best. Its totally worth our time. I will advice everybody to watch it. We can learn a lot from it. ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" This dialogue really struck me. The death of a certain character was really sad. I also loved the trick used on the warden. At some point, I think the police officer should have been punished more severely for his brutal actions."
244,True,"the main strong point of this film is a good backbone that created by multi layer, complex and unpredictable screenplay, and the dream of success inside all of us, especially in the bad times that everybody think, things goes not well, it is the story of life, and prove for us that every single second is valuable and must be seen carefully, with a plan toward future. it learn how politics works, and the chess playing of the life. and being ready for different scenarios of life. the playing of actor are good, and also overall atmosphere of film. camera, and flying shots for 1994, were really good, and state of the art. music and sound effects were really compatible with the moments of film, the other strong points of this film was the curve of info that screen play gave to viewer, it was trigger curve! as till end you can't predict any thing, you can create your own ending, happy or sad, (normally sad), but suddenly every things will change. this is really good, when you do a empathy with main character and then you will see that he finally winning the game."
245,True,"Best slow movie.You want to end but can't just to know what will happen in last. Once you started to see your interest would be created.Actually this movie is for specific person who don't get bored if there is no action or romance or hi-fi stuff. This movie contains a lot of time in talking to each other.In this movie direction is good and story-line is best but it took time to develop base.Once your interest is created you'll never pause the movie. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."
246,True,The story is utter nonsense while the acting is pretty good. I have watched this film many times and enjoyed it but fail to understand how it is the top rated film here on IMDb. The Warden plays his part to perfection and would never have allowed Andy to outwit his decades long tenure which in itself is simply ridiculous. The entire Parole board must have been bribed to keep RED ANDY & others inside so were in on the game as were those who organized work outside the prison walls. This review is critical and may not put smiles on easy to please faces but tough. there are many other much better films with fault free story lines.
247,True,"Before I review this fascinating tale of abuse, intrigue and resourcefulness taking place in a penitentiary, let me state the following... ""Bad things happen to good people."" The movie starts with a court trial for the murder of a banker's wife. Our defendant is Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) accused of this crime and all the evidence or lack of points in his direction. Found guilty Andy and other recruits (little fishes ) are bused over to Shawshank Prison. During the ride, a portly (FAT ASS)Frank Medrano starts to whine about the fact that he's not suppose to be here.The rookie cons are greeted by the Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who chillingly affirms at the end of his speech, ""Welcome to Shawshank."" Fat Ass continues to moan about being in jail but Captain Hadley (Clansy Brown) wanted to hear no part of his whining.Meanwhile the prison inmates where placing bets on which rookie con will crack under the strain of a first night in prison. As the neophytes walked down the main corridor to a loud bunch of inmate hecklers as they yelled endlessly,""Here fishy fishy."" Veteran Con Ellis Redding AKA Red our narrator played by Morgan Freeman bet two packs of smokes on Andy Dufresne. Meanwhile the majority bet on Fat Ass to crack under the taunting and teasing of the hardened inmates. The mocking was too much for poor, hysterical Fat Ass as he screamed for his Mommy as Captain Hadley beat him endlessly with his night stick as he laid lifeless on the cement floor. Prison life was presented in all it's harsh realities right from the start. The next morning Red was amazed that Andy made it through the first night without making a sound. As the movie progressed Andy needs a rock hammer to make Chess pieces. Red being the prison hustler/scrounger can get mostly anything from the outside, magazines, liquor and posters. Red and Andy develop a friendship/bond. One day the Warden offered volunteer work for the inmates to tar the roof of the guard house. The names where picked at random and Andy and Red were among the chosen for the task. The first day as the men were dipping there mops into tar buckets under the hot sun, Andy overhears Captain Hadley complaining of an cash inheritance. The other guard congratulates him on his new found cash but Hadley says the government will tax him on every penny of it. Andy takes a u-turn toward Hadley and Says, ""Do you trust your Wife?"" Hadley enraged, grabs Andy and is ready to throw him off the roof. Andy in breathless desperation replies, There's a way to gift your spouse tax free and I'll can show you how to file the papers and it's perfectly legal for a small price of three beers for each man working on the roof. A few days later it came to pass as his fellow inmate looked on at Andy as they were swigging suds on a hot roof. The Cons at least for a little while felt like men thanks to Andy and his legal advise. Andy had won the respect of his peers. Despite doing curry-favor for the guards, with W2 forms and retirement advise Andy wasn't protected either. Being constantly harassed and beaten by Boggs and his pose (The Sisters). Boggs wanted Andy for sexual favors and I'd like to tell you Andy put up a good fight but the truth is Andy ended up in the hospital infirmary while Boggs laid in the hole of solitary confinement for a month. Word got out about Andy's nemesis to Hadley and the guards and they didn't want their personal Banker harmed any more. Boggs was beaten to a pulp and the Sisters never laid a hand on Andy again.The movie continues and shows the hopelessness of an innocent educated man adjusting to an institution. Making friends and gaining respect with his knowledge in a world of maladjusted criminals. Building a library and fudging the books under the direction of the Warden. This shows how a person entering the criminal system become institutionalized on a positive side and a negative side. Veteran actor James Whitmore give an impressive performance as Brooks the original weathered Librarian. Also notable was the performance by Tommy (Gil Bellows) who takes this story in a different direction. The appeal of this movie is how everything ties together in a hopeless situation and comes out clean on the other side. The original book (Stephen King), was at best, ho-humm by critics standards but the magic of the screenplay brought this story to new heights. Kudos to the screen writing of Frank Darabont. Never get tired of this movie."
248,True,"I wanted to rate this a 10 but seriously I rated Good-fellas a 9. So I am not even sure why people rated this so high. I mean 9 is about right but at 9.3 that would mean a bunch of people gave it a 10. Seriously we are talking about the godfather and plenty of other great movies. Gladiator and so on. And its a 5 star movies (as I would like to say basing it off the hotel rankings). but 10, OK.Normally I click the spoiler alert on her just because right over it says black list and frankly when I hear the phrase ""blacklisted"" i think of Al Capone, so no thanks on that part. Which leads us right into the character Andy. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. Plus the scene was set in the late 40's. Perfect time to set a script. I love the classic cars. You don't get people saying ""that would never happen"" most people weren't even alive then. Along as they aren't talking on their cell phone in the movie, then most of the time people just watch. Andy gets falsely accused mostly to his cold demeanor in the court room. Its 2017 and I watch Snapped, forensic files and I was a avid court TV watcher before they changed, and if you go to court in the fashion he did with a judge deciding your fate (i didn't see the jury read the verdict on that one maybe i missed that part) you are definitely not going to get any sympathy from the court. Which in his case and now you need all the sympathy you can get. He does all the taxes and even money laundering for the warden when he eventually plots and escapes prison only to get that money out of an account and then go on to live life on a beach. Why let another person steal your credit for hard work when you can get credit for your own work. I wouldn't suggest breaking out of prison to do it (that would be a felony) but high stakes high rewards, right?Also with Andy's character. He made you feel different and you wanted to watch him. He was not predictable. When turned up that music in the wardens office I was like ""wow that took some guts to do."" And also about the guys who kept torturing him and raping him, that made you feel different about things. This was a person who was struggling. And you wanted to see how it ended. What makes this film great is its dark and it brings you into the movie. Books have a lot more time and lot of ways to get you into the book with words than movies can do with video. Words lead to imagination and simply can give you a very vivid image. Video is what you see and what you get. Hard to duplicate a book so the best you can do is be dark about about describe people the best you can do in a 2 hour time block. Sounds easy but its not. When you watch this movie you feel like you are in prison. They don't waste time talking about the food in prison. We got it, I am sure the food isn't exactly like a restaurant in the Hampton. They spent most of their time explaining Andy.This is another story about a person who didn't fit in with what society has labeled him and he told people the truth and they didn't believe him. So he figured another way to bring the people who held him captive while fixing his own life. It didn't happen over night. He didn't just take what life gave him, he took what life gave him and used it against them and kept a memory of it and wrote everything down. My favorite part is when Tim ribbons is talking to Morgan freeman saying "" i had to come prison to learn to be a criminal."". I got chills from hearing that. Cause that is the truth. A smart banker mixed with criminals is very dangerous. They know all the laws, the loop holes and they have the patience and confidence to do it. I wouldn't rank this movie higher than the godfather like a lot of people have it on here. But its ranked as a 5 star movie to movie. Which puts it in the category of the godfather, casino, Good-fellas, Brave-heart, and the Gladiator. Then again this film is unique, the prison guards beat the lights out of people after the light are out."
249,True,"Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne Bob Gunton as Warden Norton William Sadler as Heywood James Whitmore as Librarian Written and directed by Frank Darabont Based on a novel by Stephen King Crime, DramaRated R142 minutes| Roger Ebert September 23, 1994 | Print Page""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
250,True,"I can say without even thinking about it that this movie, is the greatest movie i've ever seen, and i have seen a few. Everything in this movie from the way it is shot to the story makes this a must see for every so called ""Movie Fan"".The story about Andy Dufresne that is sent to prison for lifetime for a crime he maybe didn't even commit. And this movie shows how he handles his time in prison, and how he helped his inmates with getting better facilities by giving time and effort to get the funds needed. And don't even get me started on the ending, the ending takes the movie to a whole other level by showing us how he has been planning his escape from the start and the emotional pay of when Andy and Ellis meets in the final scene.All in all this is the best movie i've ever seen and probably the best i will ever see"
251,True,"You live only for me I stick medals into your face You are entirely devoted to me You love me because I don't love youYou bleed for my salvation A little cut and you're turned on The body already completely disfigured It doesn't matter, whatever pleases is allowedI hurt you I'm not sorry It's good for you Hear how it screamsWith you I have the choice of torment Barbed wire in the urethral tract Throw your flesh in salt and pus At first you die, but then you live moreBites, kicks, hard blows Needles, pliers, a blunt saw What you wish, I don't say no And insert rodents into youI hurt you I'm not sorry It's good for you Hear how it screamsYou are the ship, I'm the captain Where should this journey go? I see your face in the mirror"
252,True,"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it."
253,True,"The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
254,True,"Personally i'm a big sucker for a good story and this movie certainly offers that,the characters were well portrayed by the Actors. A movie that should be on every ones watch list. What i loved about this movie was it made a connection between the audience and the characters and i think this is a big YES when you are also trying to tell a story with the screenplay. This is also a movie that can be watched a numerous amount of times as it's a movie that leaves you wanting more as the Actors made that connection between the characters they played and the people that watched it. Come to think of it, i don't think i would change a thing in this title, to me this is an excellent example of what a movie should make people feel."
255,True,"The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time. Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not ""some actors."" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here. Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development. I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings. Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed. It is hard to fathom that a ""prison"" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison. Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe ""The Shawshank Redemption."" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. ""Shawshank Redemption"" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within."
256,True,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
257,True,"This movie is great, it is a heart warming film that depicts the struggles of a man who is faultily convicted of a crime he did not commit. he is then thrust into prison where he must fight for his life day to day. he learns to protect himself and make several friends that support him while he is on the inside. this film is filled with the gruesome realities of life in prison, and the fact that men and woman every year are put away for crimes they did not commit. but none the less he spends his days learning the law and fighting to get himself out. he then provides others advice in the law, in hopes that he can help them escape to freedom."

259,True,"Leading their roles, Freeman and Robbins are truly outstanding.This engagingly, with good heart and simple movie will entertain you marvelously.Red, is jailed because of his wife's murder. He murdered her by disabling the brakes on her car.Andy is the new one in jail, he can't get used to the new life and many prisoners think he's a snob person with obnoxious manners.Finding Red, Andy also finds a way to escape all the obscure treats put in front of him by the prison life. Starting a new life inside prison, first as a librarian then as financial assistant for the prison director, Andy goes through his conviction.But there is one secret that Andy reveals to Red that will change their lives once they're freed."
260,True,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. This is a movie that will always continue to keep me on the edge of my seat. I give this movie a 10/10. Perfect performances."
261,True,"I personally don't like movies that take place in prisons. That is because I cant stand watching people being imprisoned or tortured in some way.And that usually happens in those movies. But this one is different. It really has an interesting story. And a good plot.ry That's why I generally like it. And the actors performed more than fine. The only reason for which I can not give it top marks is - it does happen in prison. I also had to admit that the is a yucky part. And I don't think that a person would be actually able to do it. To swim through 16m of sh*t to freedom. Freedom is valuable, but people cant do it, like they cant spread wings and fly for freedom :)"
262,True,"Of the 7 nominations received he was not any. She competed against two behemoths like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump and still no one crossed out loser. For all that we have seen swarming around the top of the biggest movies ever filmed. I was half past two stuck to the chair of cinema without even blinking hours, savoring every minute and begging to be longer, because I realized that I was watching a virgin and that this was a masterpiece. Staff face out of the room I can not forget: the satisfaction of the idiot. Silly happy face. Happy to have been part of something big, and silly because you can not yet comment on anything until this very nice feeling to go away.But the biggest thing is the last half hour. When I was asking God knows who, who Shawshank lasted longer, I gave that to me is the best outcome of the history of cinema, for the duration of your footage, for as tying each of the ends and being splendidly filmed. Half an hour we were fascinated, again, to the thousand people who would fill the then-and defunct was the largest room in Donosti. Word of mouth was the most resounding success of The Shawshank Redemption. ""Hey, you have to go see that movie, it's amazing ..."" or something like that, I guess.Based on a story by Stephen King, Darabont adapted a masterful script that was his debut. This film, say the gossip, impressed especially teens and twenties for having one of the best stories of friendship between men. Accustomed to see tough guys who crashed five, forced here to look with new eyes the protagonists and its history, just hallucinated. Personally, I think it is the most beautiful ever told about the friendship between two men history. Morgan Freeman, as we did in Million Dollar Baby, is the main character who narrates throughout the film the adventures of his friend, in the end you realize that you knew nothing.I think Morgan Freeman plays the role of his life here, not Driving Miss Daisy or Million Dollar Baby. The same Tim Robbins, his absent expressiveness think that came in handy Dufresne's character. Side, all luxury: the perfect warden, orderlies ditto captain, James Whitmore -the unforgettable older-, game of prisoners who accompanies our friends as much. All perfect. A great address with them. I think nobody doubt it.In short, a masterpiece like the crown of a pine. A film that, while not teach you anything new, makes you love cinema like few others. A photograph beautiful, excellent assembly and a colossal adaptation.

263,True,"Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex. Guards beat and kill an inmate. A prisoner is shot and killed by a man with a rifle. There is also a scene in which a character crawls through 500 yards of a sewer pipe filled with excrement. There is also frequent profanity, including ""f--k"" and its variations. However, the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions and a sense of maintaining perseverance and hope in the darkest of hours."

265,True,"Shawshank Redemption: Shawshank Redemption is a classic movie that is well written and beautifully produced. With a lot of suspense and action it is a movie that everybody should watch. Tim Robbins an actor that has been in many movies such as Nothing To Lose, Bob Roberts, Arlington Road, and many more, plays an important role in the movie Shawshank Redemption. Andy Dufresne, who is played by Tim Robbins is a banker that is convicted of killing his wife and another man that she was with. While in jail he meets a guy named Red who is played by Morgan Freeman. Red is known as the ¨guys who can get things,¨ from cigarettes to rock picks he can get it all. Andy keeps a low profile in jail for the first few years. He then becomes friends with a group of guys in the jail that includes Red, but also makes some enemies. With a lot of fighting scenes it helps show the real life events of what jail would be like. On the other hand, the director does a good job in making Andy a very interesting character from his personality and actions. He is very sneaky and persistent, but is also determined and fearless in some situations. The one thing that might turn away a younger audience is the language. The Director does a fantastic job with setting the story and letting it play out but also uses a lot of language that would be used in jail. He shows how lonely, how different ,how depressing, and how life changing jail can be. Throughout the movie the audience takes away a lot of lessons that is shown through the actors lives and stories. One iconic line that I loved was from Morgan Freeman, when he was talking to Andy after he got out if the ¨hole,¨ when he said ¨Get busy living or get busy dying.¨ Frank, the director of this movie directed over 10 movies such as, The Green Mile, and The Majestic. He has been nominated for 3 academy awards and one golden globe award. He has worked with many famous and well known actors such as Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks. The movie has won many awards including, best picture, best actor in a leading role, best film editing, and many more. The movie is a well written and well produced movie that had a lot of twist and turns that grabs the audience attention and keeps them watching and wanting to re watch the movie. The plot was well put together and flowed throughout the movie which was shown in many different occasions. I believe that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen and is one of the best movies that you will see too."
266,True,"The Shawshank Redemption: Accepting the bleak and harsh realities that present themselves in our lives is part of what it means to mature as a person. No film I have ever seen so deeply encapsulates this sentiment as Frank Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. Two convicted felons live out their life sentences in the Shawshank prison, usually by outfoxing guards with red's smuggling network or just rambling with old chums. The Shawshank Redemption is a masterfully crafted film because the excellent cinematography, engaging plot, and Tim Robbin's acting eloquently reflects the frustrations of a wrongly convicted man named Andy Dufresne, and his struggle to maintain one of the most valuable aspects of humanity: hope.The outstanding cinematography and drab grey shading help convey a bleak setting at the beginning of the film. Tense moments were punctuated with dark shadows cast over the actor's faces, and intensified further with Morgan Freeman's dulcet narration. The establishing shots of the prison were dull and grey, akin to the monotonous lifestyles of the institutionalized convicts that had accepted their lot in life. The somber tone created by dull colors and shading slowly captivated my attention, leaving me with baited breath in anticipation for the events to unfold.The majority of the story was set in Shawshank prison, where our main characters, 'Red', and Andy Dufresne stare the reality of a life sentence in the face. Throughout the film, the two main characters complement one another with their incongruent views of what being behind bars truly means. Red believed that they should accept their current situation and make the best of it, whereas Andy tried to busy himself with his hobbies: keeping his mind focused on things beyond the walls that caged him. I found this optimistic behavior incredibly inspiring as a viewer. There is truly a positive gem of wisdom to be found in a person who is thrusted into an impossible situation, and still finds a perseverance to escape it as Andy Dufresne did.The actors in this film performed extremely well overall, and Morgan Freeman's narration enriched my experience of this film immensely, because it complemented Tim Robin's delivery of Andy's character. Tim Robin's acting during Andy Dufresne's first interaction with Red was so well done, I felt as though Morgan Freedman's narration was manifesting on screen rather than being acted out. The entire cast succeeded especially well in bringing their respective characters to life: not forcefully exuding emotion, but casually, and crisply conveying memorable character interactions.The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful piece which stands in a class of its own: original, nuanced, and engaging. A great deal of care, time, and consideration was placed into the production of this film. I reflect back on the many other films have emerged in recent decades: films that tried to emulate Shawshank Redemption's sleek mature essence, to no avail. Truly this film stands without peer by my metric. I have enjoyed the viewing and critiquing process of this film immensely, it is truly a treasure which I would recommend anyone watch for their enjoyment as well."
267,True,"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit."
268,True,"Sometimes you decide to watch a movie from the hype that is round it. Shawshank Redemption is one such movie deciding on which you will never regret. It is the perfect feel good movie of a man who goes down the pit of human failure but rises slowly from it through grit and determination. It is one such movie that makes you believe in your potential as a human being. There are very few movies which has such perfect story telling style as well as sequence like the Shawshank Redemption. A must watch for both the movie buff as well as the casual watcher. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online. Highly Recommended."
269,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."""
270,True,"Freedom is important, and never give up! I think this movie has given me an important lesson, since never give up is significant to a person, he can abandon anything except living. I really like this movie, and I used to see it in 2010, after this year, I also watched it many times for learning English. Although I am still improving my English by now, I think I will never give up. Thanks to this movie, since the actors and the story are really amazing, which can make me fall in love in this movie. I think this movie is really good, and I also stated a lot of reasons as above. If I can watch this movie one more time, I will recommend this movie to my friends."
271,True,"This film delivers an emotional and soulful performance. The entire ensemble, big names and small, was so perfectly cast. The brilliant collaboration between director, writer, actors and even the music department is one for the history books. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on screen chemistry is undeniable. The narration really captures the story and makes the audience feel like they're watching real life tragedy. The director's unique take on using a blue tinted lens really demonstrated the misery and dark tone of the plot. A very powerful ""art imitating life"" take on the corruption in the judicial systems. This film will go down in history as my favorite movie."
272,True,"I think that this movie has many important elements that now the whole world have missing,Poor of values how society is now with many problems how all the humans are in war. but too exist people that never go down without the circumstances, and they always have hope in their life.all the actors of the movie are important and each one has one piece important for the movie, the plot of the movie is about one man that works in a bank and his wife is in love with another man he is famous golf player. and some day somebody kills the wife and her lover, and the police think that was Andy Dufresne and the court gives him a two life's sentence.when Andy is in the jail he is alone, and he knows a good man, he starts a relationship, and some day when he and another prisoners are in jail, Andy has the opportunity to help to one of the officers and he stars to work in the library of the jail and Andy receives privileges. after 40 years in prison and many abuses to his person he can more, but he has hope and his friend. Andy has a plan and he starts to destroy the wall of his cell. one afternoon he says goodbye to his only friend, and says that he is going to wait for him and work in some beach in Mexico, but first he needs to go to one place and looking for some rock unique and see what is in there.the friend thinks that Andy is going to kill himself this night and he is worry. but in the next morning, when the official starts to say the name of each one Andy in not there and starts to looking for him. when the official looks in his cell finds that he escapes for the wall, he does a hole and escapes. Andy does his plan very well and find the man that really kill his wife, and he starts his new life, he was the first man to escapes of this prison. Andy always keeps in his mind that he is going to go out and he does, but he works day to day.and is an example for all the prisoners.Marlen Guadalupe Almaraz Martinez"
273,True,"The film talks us about of the situation that live the starring role Andy, between his life before to access to prison and after to escape, also the friendships who know the significance of freedom and hope. while that the conditions on the real life into prison's context is very difficult and risk; like so the life with those problems is more tedious, Andy and his friends do good things to the prison.Mister Brooks is a very important character on the story; as an example of life, Brooks is the librarian at the prison, and at the moment that he is free, he has a big depression, because he doesn't support the way that live the modern people out prison. and he decides to commit suicide for the pressure and fear, as the limits for his age and physical condition, truly Brooks inspire to Andy to keep the library in excellent conditions.Andy has many problems, but that don't stop him, with his planes for make the Shawshank's prison a better place, with the help of others, and the final part he escapes to the town and he gets the revenge of the chief in prison and captain that rapes him, stealing the money and discovering the bad planes of them with prison."
274,True,"The Shawshank Redemption ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie about how a man, Andy, played my Tim Robins, deals with being in prison. It is told through the eyes of fellow convict Red, played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman has an excellent voice for narrating. Andy Dufresne is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to prison. While in prison he helps others to give his life purpose. The theme is about dealing with life no matter what comes your way. Andy deals with being lock up by helping his fellow inmates. Andy coping summed up best with the character Tommy. Andy helps Tommy pass the high school equivalency test. Helping others aids Andy in passing the time. Another example of this can is when Brooks, played by James Whitmore tries to cope with life outside prison. He does not learn how to deal outside the jail and commits suicide. Red says it's institutionalized; that after so long you know of no other way to live. Every man has his breaking point. Andy found his and escaped. It is an excellent movie, well written good acting and filming. The actors interact with each other exceedingly well. Making the audience feel as if the group has been together for a long time."
275,True,"It's a great movie with no doubt, Andy Dufresne is considered guilty of killing his wife and his affair, so he is transfered to the prison of shawshank. They show perfectly how is the prison life and also show us the importance of some virtues like friendship and hope, and a great representation of the sense of justice the movie shows you a humanity sense that can change your life.The cast was good enough but, it appears to me that Tim Robbins shows a character with no great expression in the movie so however Morgan Freeman shows a simply man and a so much depth character and some parts of the movie sounds a little boring to me, but although the movie is very well written and it really worth it."
276,True,"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. A new platform has been made for us www.flickstree.com which not only provides us with movie links but also gives us a platform to watch them online"
277,True,"Personally I find Shawshank Redemption the best drama film I've seen. This is a movie that should be watched when you are at least 12. The film is based on Stephen King's novel: Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption. It's a story of 2 prisoners : Red and Andy's prison life and how both men lives are bonded for 20 years in the prison. Frank Darabont's outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's Novel. His direction and script is one of the best in film history. Morgan Freeman perfectly acted out one of the most recognisable character in film history: Red. In the film, his voice matches perfectly the tone and rhythm of the lines he was suppose to say. Although, some will say Freeman should have won the academy award in 1994 for Shawshank Redemption, I personally still feel Tom Hanks should win the award (like he already did) because although both actors' narration was extremely good, Hank's acting was better than Freeman. In conclusion, I feel Shawshank Redemption should remain it's status as one of the best drama films ever made and should be remembered forever. 10/10"
278,True,"Justice, intelligence and happiness. How then do everything you want people? This movie actually gives people the answer to this problem. Great theater, great staff and a great story. Sometimes we succumb to despair or simple in our lives, that we are ashamed of our own miseries tuned in film. Life is just to believe and to hope. Even if you do not give up and hide what you do not believe that you own, I was hoping imagine, work, and until the end whether to believe it. Because, if you want to succeed and be happy, nothing can stand in front of you. Now I do not know how much you watch a lot of movies, but I'm sure that if you watch or have watched this film. This film is the best film of your life."
279,True,"This Movie The Greatest Ever the best one for prisons life it's deserve watching it more than one time and you won't waste your time on it Morgan Freeman made his best movie the montage was so good as it was in 1994 No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Frank Darabont the director was amazing Tim Robbins made it perfectly i really can't say anything about this awesome movie all reviews said it already in end you will find yourself learned something after watching this movie and you will know the true meaning of freedom and how people in prison feel after 40 years in prison in fact if you miss this movie you miss your life :D deserve all the rewards,Oscars and nominations."
280,True,"the movie i have watched the most.This is because of the amazing storyline and great performance!.Like ""Forrest Gump,"" to which ""Shawshank"" bears a coincidental but commercially convenient resemblance, this is a story of saintly endurance. Though Andy is abused by a prison bully who rapes him, a brutal guard who beats him and a crafty warden who uses Andy's banking skills to launder the vast amounts of cash he's siphoning off the system, Andy's patience, tolerance and selfless concern for his fellow man see him through.In a film that stands or falls on the central character's amiability, Tim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is from Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really determines how we feel about him. Darabont's direction is precise and assured, without being terribly imaginative.Best,Frits"

282,True,"In my opinion this movie is one of the finest films made in the nineties. It's a poignant story about hope and life to the humans and That's what makes a film like this more than a movie It gives us a lesson about the value of the life and How important the hope in our life because a Human without hope is a dead person.You really will get pulled into the story as it goes on. Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie and as he says ""Keep busy living or get busy dying"". If you haven't seen it then you should start now because this movie is really one of the best movies I ever watched.That's why I give this movie 10/10 because you will never find another movie like this taking about the Important of hope this way ."
283,True,"This highest rated movie deserves its position. There is no doubt that the Shawshank Redemption is the best in its own era, as a 1994 American drama film, and it marks the career top of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. As it is adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, the banker who was sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover. It tells the story of who claims of his innocence works his way out from scratch by a non-innocent way. During his time at the prison, he made friend with a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and got himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in the money-laundering operation. Surprisingly enough, the film was a box office disappointment, despite the fact that it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. There is no doubt that today it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, due to its culturally, historically, or aesthetically significance."
284,True,"They have mixed crazy, love, joy, hate in a perfect way. This movie you all have to watch. I think more movie makers and actors need to watch this and take it in. In all these years I haven't seen something like it. This movie shows that going to prison isn't all that fun. That a lot of people sit so long it becomes their home. It's a lot of powerful actors in this movie but that is common in a lot of movies. Why I think you should watch this is because of the mix of it all. Like a good chef. Allot of people can get good groceries but only a few can cook like a pro."
285,True,"This is a movie that you don't see only once. This is a movie that you keep seeing and enjoying every single time. I remember when this movie was in theaters; I haven't seen it back then and was not interested at all. I saw Forrest Gump in 1994 and for years I didn't care much about this movie that was nominated for 7 Oscars and didn't get a single one. I saw this movie for the first time somewhat 6 years after its release. Shaw-shank leaves you with unbelievable feelings of hope, freedom, friendship and an intense desire to unchain yourself. I can fairly say, with no overstatements here that the impact of this movie stays with me for several days every time I see it. It all comes down to one simple choice "" get busy living or get busy dying"". The key word here is ""busy"". When Andy finally breaks free, you don't see him at the end sipping vodka on the beach; he is working polishing an old boat and restoring a hotel in the ""hope"" of running a successful business.... Finding peace and happiness after overcoming an injustice needs you to set goals and work to achieve them. Happiness is found in the journey, on the way, not in the goal itself. Brooks failed to see it. Andy learned it the hard way and the viewers are lucky to learn it the easy way."
286,True,"The perfect movie. Stephen King is a genius and Darabont adapted him brilliantly. Truly the masterpiece of all masterpieces. The quintessential piece of American cinema. The classic story of redemption executed perfectly. Recipe for a perfect movie=Stephen King writes source material + Morgan Freeman narrates + Tim Robbins stars, and Frank Darabont adapts and directs. This is my favorite film hands down. The scene where Andy takes over the PA and puts on Mozart is possibly the greatest scene in film history. The sequencing is truly breathtaking. The roller-coaster ride of emotion that this film takes one on is something that can only truly be experienced once, and yet with each consecutive viewing one finds new elements that enrich the viewing experience time and time again. Thank you to the artists involved. Thank you for bringing such brilliance and perfection into the world so that those that have and will come after will have a standard that one knows is unacheivable and yet one also knows that it is ones duty and that in order to call oneself 'artist', one must constantly strive for such greatness."
287,True,"This is without a doubt still my absolute favourite film, ever. It's a film that I can always be in the mood to watch, whether I'm feeling high or low due to the unbelievably victorious ending. The entire film is beautifully shot, with no need for any special effects and it does so well based solely on the story itself, the phenomenal acting from Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red.The basis of the plot, for those who haven't seen it (where have you been hiding?!) is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is accused of double homicide of his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank prison for two life-sentences in the 1940's. Shawshank prison is full of corruption and when evidence that can prove Andy's innocence is discovered, even this can't help him escape the walls, so he must find an alternative.My personal favourite scene is when Andy finally escapes the prison, after digging through his cell wall with a rock hammer, crawling through 500 feet of sewage pipes and coming out the other end with the wardens forged accounts. Andy stands at the end of the sewage pipe with his arms raised looking up to the sky, finally feeling free.Andy is also my favourite character in the film, and Tim Robbins earned his place as one of my favourite actors after this role. Andy is known to be a quiet, calm man - wrongfully accused and locked up, trying to get through day-to-day of his sentence. Tim Robbins never raises his voice above a whisper, is softly spoken and this lends itself to your feelings and sympathy for Andy from almost the very start of the film. His relationship with Red is a thing of beauty, showing two men from different backgrounds - one actually guilty of murder - becoming close friends with mutual respect for each other.There is no part of this story that isn't incredible, the film doesn't drag for one moment and you genuinely want more when the credits roll up.The film is based on the novella by Stephen King 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'."
288,True,"Can I write in my language? of course you won't allow me.... lolShawshank Redemption.... So this movie is worth for 1st top in this list with the highest rating.... This movie is old, same as my age.... with not very original story, but have the best twist plot ending ever..... I could say WAAW at the end of movie.... But narration from Morgan Freeman , the god lol, very stroke my heart....Tempo : Slow, but the scene was very detail , every scene watched without bored Act : All god level Camera : The narrow area of the jail, can be exposed hugely Ending : The best Ending ever, I cried for the ending... surely cried like a babyWell, if we can rate it in 100, I will give my own at 101 for this damned movie :)"
289,True,"I've watched this movies just because it's the highest rated movie of all time. Also everyone I know who's had watched this movie prior to me was going like, ""Greatest crime movie ever"". Honestly I don't think it deserves that title. There are lot many and way better movies than this one. But talking about this one in particular, great screenplay, good character building, more than sufficient suspense, and a good old ""Happy Ending"". Great one time watch. The concept of taking few pieces of concrete every day out of the wall and throwing out in the open seems a bit absurd to me, I mean that process would take ages to dig a hole through wall and then out of the prison through ground and that to big enough for a man to pass comfortably."
290,True,"If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. The film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."
291,True,One of the best films i have ever seen. This film is interesting and very clever at times. Defiantly worth watching at least once in your life. Although long this film is not slow and excites you to the point of wanting more. The ending was very good. The ending is sort of predictable if you think about it enough but ties up the story nicely. Morgan Freeman plays the character Red very well (like Morgan Freeman does) and is the narrator too since the film is narrated by Red. It shows what prison is like very well. Like i said before it is in my top 10 favorite movies next to movies like Rocky V and For a Few Dollars More.
292,True,"The movie sets an example of the impact the world of cinemas can induce on us. In the current scenario where the movie makers, directors, all look to lure the general public with science fictions and other high stuffs, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes a rest. It creates its story around traditional background of common characteristics like hope, belief, self-esteem, transformation and most important redemption. The movie is set on location of prison, that is quite a thinking, say innovation in this field as well. The best thing about the movie is the fact that unlike many movies which focuses on hero, this movie focuses on the surroundings. In that way it binds us to the surrounding and helps us to live as a part of movie with respect to common persons. We find ourselves in unison with the feelings of sorrow, hope grief, etc. While maintaining the poetic and moving dialogue, Darabont also proves that a film can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience with its dialogues only. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings. It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know. Coming to credits away from acting part, Roger Deakens have done a beautiful work as far as cinematography is concerned. The positions of camera and the awe struck beauty of prison shown in starting scene is just mind blowing. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime. Darabont wrote the film to observe the story, while a little focus on punching it up or upstaging it. The actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. The movie is really a not one timer. You can taste its flavor again and again. The movie will tend to bind you in its surrounding many times and in years to come."
293,True,"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
294,True,"One out of every five people will have watched this movie at least once.This movie has every attribute of life. This movie has its moments. It's a classic prison movie. I like to watch this movie from time to time. This movie has Crime Thriller Suspense Plotting all intertwined well knit. I own a BluRay copy of this movie.This movie has Morgan Freeman not doing his typical routine. Great Casting. The prison routine shown in the movie is very realistic.This movie deserves the Top Ratings. Good Job Shawshank Redemption Team. My Conclusion ""CAN'T BEAT A CLASSIC"".The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation."

296,True,"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him ""a particularly remorseless and icy man."" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. ""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,"" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. ""I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.""By : JANET MASLIN The New York Times Published: September 23, 1994"
297,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shaw shank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shaw shank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."
298,True,"This movie is an all time fave of mine. the story telling is brilliant and the acting excellent! it is a story of a very long friendship between two convicted men. they go through rough times together in prison but also have the occasional happy moment they share amongst themselves as well as a well mixed bunch of other inmates from all sorts of walks of life. Eventually the pay off comes when Andy finally receives his small tool for rock carving and we eventually find out he's been using this tiny hammer, the size of a pinky finger, to ever so patently dig himself out of prison. The sheer amount of years it would have taken him to do so is unfathomable! The ending is amazingly sweet and it makes for a feel good film over and over again! happy watching"
299,True,"Yhe Shawshank Redemption has earned a reputation for being one of the most popular films of all time. Despite an unimpressive performance in the cinema box-office, it regularly tops 'most popular movies' votes. Tim Robbins said of the film: 'Why has it endured? ... The reason why it's had a profound impact on people has a lot to do, I think, with its spirit, and the hope within it. The idea that over a long period of time, someone's ambitions can come true, that resilience and persistence pay off.This movie is about a man who discovers himself after he is sentenced to life in prison.Andy plays the role of the innocent man, who is doing time for a crime he did not commit. Andy Dufresne is a banker before he was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Andy is shipped to Shawshank Maximum Security Prison to spend the time of his life.Andy slowly becomes friends with Red, an experienced lifer and his gang. Shortly Andy also becomes popular with the prison guards also the vicious Captain Hadley offered him protection against the jail's not so friendly convicts in exchange for financial counseling.The warden also takes benefits from Andy's banking knowledge by exchanging privileges for creative bookkeeping. Over twenty years of time in prison Andy is able to maintain his sanity and dignity by his mental force."
300,True,"yes, is most of on great film and helps to show very beauty film That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking."
301,True,"Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. This is the highest film based upon movie reviews here on IMDb with a 9.3 out of 10 beating The Dark Knight, Terminator 2 and Aliens. The reason why i loved this movie is the elements it's trying to reach for example friendship between all the inmates, corruption of the warden who i enjoyed watching him die and of course redemption for Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The acting is excellent, the direction is pretty great and the story is also great a movie that never looses hope made by a very talented director Frank Darabont. Although the 9.3 rating is a bit way too much i mean i enjoyed all the movies i listed on this review a bit more including Godfather. This movie definitely belongs on the Top 250 movies of all time just not number 1 maybe in place number 10 or 15 maybe? Anyways this movie is great if you haven't seen it check it out i give it a A- and a 8.5/10"
302,True,"This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls.The most overrated movie of the century. Shawshank is the perfect example of a film that can fool you into thinking it's great. It's mawkish, fantastical, sappy and manipulative. It's merely good and it's laughably that people actually place it next to masterpieces such as Rashomon, Citizen Kane, Notorious, Apocalypse Now, 2001 and Raging Bull"

304,True,"The best way to spend a lazy night. it's deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film. Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent. He adapted King's story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from ""Rocky."" Guts equals glory. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. A 21-year friendship between a lifer (Morgan Freeman) and a New England banker convicted of murder (Tim Robbins) is the focus of this gripping 1994 prison drama, capably directed and adapted by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's short novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. A passing reference to The Count of Monte Cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling"
305,True,"I think this was a decent prison drama. And as far as prison dramas go, it's one of the best I remember. But from that to being one of the best movies of all time, it's quite a stretch. That place is taken forever by movies like Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, Empire Strikes Back, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, or The Godfather. Still, it has a lot going for it. The leads are very good, the story is almost believable, and you actually root for the heroes.I think the reason it got such a good reputation and unlimited reruns on TV is that it has a positive message. There is a guy who goes to jail for life and he still finds the energy to search for ways to improve his situation. The crawling through the sewage pipe at the end of the movie is the metaphor for living life with the right mindset, in other words doing all you have to do to regain freedom and dignity. I often compare this movie to Cool Hand Luke, which is very similar, and better in many ways. The message is the same, only there is no happy ending, so Cool Hand Luke gets a lot less screening."
306,True,"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library."

308,True,"If you haven't seen this movie you must. Great story and acting. A Stephen King story in a prison?Morgan Freeman gives his best performance to date and the same applies to Tim Robbins. Little bit cliché, but interestingly twisted story: innocently imprisoned for killing his wife. while having his struggles in prison, he finds a lifelong friendship. Dialog is good, excellent story telling. Technical execution is masterful. Highly recommend to buy it on DVD or blue-ray. Watch it whenever you are down, it will give you plenty of positive thoughts. I could go on, praising the film, actors etc, but instead just watch it and you will experience and understand it's powerful message."
309,True,"this is more than a film. this is story of human being.all I can see is suffering of peoples in life . we are all prisoners of this world. we live with each other and at the same time we are alone.why we live ? where are we? what is the main reason of life? who is satisfied with life? if we want to escape from this condition, where can we go?is there any real friend in our life? how can we maid our wishes?Why is it we can't turn away when this film pops up during one of those weekend marathons? We've all seen it before, we know what's going to happen, yet we still delight in re-experiencing the struggle of these character to overcome overwhelming odds. Why is that?Is it something spiritual? Something deep within us, a yearning for universal absolution the film provides? Or could it be something more Earthbound? Perhaps, something more closely tied to our own biology? One can't deny the Christ-like symbol in Andy's final gesture of triumph, yet why then does the film work for all regardless of belief?"
310,True,"When I first saw the movie, I thought to myself, I don't know that this would be worth my time, it just seems like some odd drama..."", but being #1 top rated of IMDb, along with Morgan Freeman as an actor, certainly helps boost the chances of people watching.Luckily, to my surprise, the movie turned out to be emotionally heartwarming, filled with an excellent narrative and story that it tells. All the characters have fleshed-out personalities and interesting conflicts that keep you reeling for more. One thing that's good to note is some of the twists the movie delivers, whether that be an unexpected death that leaves you shocked, or a surprising twist that leaves you wide-eyed in your seat.By the time the movie ends, it's like you've been deprived of a drug. One of the best, if NOT best, movies I have ever seen. Hollywood could learn many things from movies like this."
311,True,"I believe that this film is the best story ever and One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life i remember the first time watching this My brain was bleeding this movie gives you a feeling that is hard to get this day. simply a true masterpiece. and now for who don't know the story. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton. ( b**tch be cool its my first review nobody begins perfectly)"
312,True,"The movie Shawsshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne who is a convicted because he supposedly kill his wife and her love, The narrator is Morgan Freeman as Red, a man that has been in the jail for a long time, Andy is a banker and has very determinant personality. Andy helps the warden with financial things, he is a librarian and he makes the prison better. I like the movie because it show difficult situations in life that you have to face. The loyalty of Red and Andy is beautiful, you can know that in life there are real friends, Andy strengths proves that always you have to stay strong and solve your problems. Shawsshank redemption have the highest score on many trustful pages, there are many beautiful teachings about life. So what are you waiting for this incredible movie?"
313,True,"This movie is about a man during the middle of XX century that gets imprisoned because of an act of injustice, when he enters the prison he starts to socialize with the prisoners and to improve the economic life of the guards and the warden, also he improves the conditions of the library and makes different favors to receive stuff from different people.I really enjoy the movie, is not the typically action movie, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat, also all the components, the music,the expressions, the dialogues, everything perfectly fits.I would recommend the movie because is one of the best movies i ever see, it has a very good argument, the details of the different scenes, like the woodcarving, the police beatings, etc, that gave a realistic touch to the film.Also this movie makes you keeps your eyes open to watch everything it happens."
314,True,"I remember watching this film a few months ago, being a bit sceptical about it. I hadn't seen many films because I hadn't seen the right ones. This film changed everything and now i have a deep love to films thanks to Frank Darabont and his masterful directing. Andy Dufresne is a symbol of hope, that even though he gets gang raped he manages to fend them off and disable one of them for life. Even though he nearly gets thrown off a building for trying to help a guard, he still manages to get all their protection and basically lives like a free man inside those walls. he teaches everyone close to him inside that prison a lesson, That when you hope good things happen, Read learns this after Andy escapes, and he clings to hope in his parole hearing and he gets released too.I think it is a perfect film and moved me greatly."
315,True,"This movie is one masterpiece. I would say that excitement Became Double as u reach the end of the Movie. You can not simply guess what is going to be the next move or what actually is going on behind all this , a Little hammer can not dig a Hole but, when it comes to 20 years it does. I was literally shocked to see when Jail superintendent Started throwing pebbles around, and across the wall and one accidentally Penetrated in One of the Wall.It was like Oh my god moment for me .. and the whole Movie Takes a sharp Turn and rolls on.... This is superbly composed Famliy Movie and the Morgan Free Man did it like ever he does.I would recommend this Movie to all My family and Friends."

317,True,"The great sleep gamble People who do not get enough sleep run the risk of developing serious health problems including cancer, diabetes and heart disease, experts have today warned. The British public has been accused of becoming 'arrogant' in ignoring the vital importance of getting enough shut-eye each night. Smartphones, social media, tablet computers and watching television in bed, have all been blamed for interrupting the body's production of the sleep inducing hormone melanin.'Metabolic health, in addition to genetic predisposition, is largely dependent on behavioral factors such as dietary habits and physical activity,' experts wrote in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal. The study said that addressing some types of sleep disturbance  such as sleep appeal  may have a directly beneficial effect on patients' metabolic health. But a far more common problem is people simply not getting enough sleep, particularly due to the increased use of devices such as tablets and portable gaming devices. The disruption of the body's natural sleeping and waking cycle, often experienced by shift workers and those working at night, has also been found to have a clear effect on metabolic health, as well as an increase in rates of chronic illness and early death.The prevalence of life-threatening health problems, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease is increased in those who compromise on their sleep, studies claim. Professor Russell Foster, at the University of Oxford, accused people of being 'arrogant' in turning their back on years of evolution that has seen the human species rely on the sleep cycle. He said: ""We are the supremely arrogant species; we feel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact that we have evolved under a light-dark cycle. What we do as a species, perhaps uniquely, is override the clock. And long-term acting against the clock can lead to serious health problems."" A person's body clock is, in part, driven by exposure to light and a need to sleep and rest is the product of a time when people were active during the day, resting at night. But modern life has interrupted sleep patterns. A 24-hour society coupled with technology disturbs the natural order, leading people to sleep at irregular times. Experts said smartphones, tablet computers and social media keep people more alert later into the evening. The blue light emitted by the devices has a shorter wavelength than whiter light, acting to inhibit the body's production of melanin - the hormone which induces a need to sleep.Havard University's Professor Charles Czeisler said: ""Light exposure, especially short wavelength bluish light in the evening, will reset our circadian rhythms to a later hour, postponing the release of the sleep-promoting hormone melanin and making it more difficult for us to get up in the morning. It's a big concern that we're being exposed to much more light, sleeping less and, as a consequence, may suffer from many chronic diseases."" source: Daily Mail Nehézségi saint: középfok"
318,True,"this is the best film that has ever been made. No apologies to The Godfather: Great film, but this.... THIS is the culmination of perfect casting, narration, slowly-developing scenes, film score... There's not a single moment in the film that I can point to and claim that it ought to be different.﻿ There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes.

319,True,"good film very interesting to watch. Age rating suitable to film genre.This i8s a strange thing to says about a film set in a prison but it has a way of creating a warm hold on our feelings Va's it makes us a member of a family.Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions.""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.It buses the narrators calm,observant voice to include us in the story of the men who have formed a community behind bars.it is deeper than most films;about community in a lifetime,based on friendship,hope,redemption and belief.The only their film to have moved me in such a strong way was ""To kill a mockingbird"".Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.This is one of those film's cancan watch over and over again and always pick up something new from.A must see film."
320,True,"This movie is by far one of the greatest compositions out there. It constantly engages you without having gun fights or explosions. It intellectually engages you. It invites you into a whole new world, into the minds of convicts. It all ties in perfectly with its ending and seeing corruption being overthrown and justice winning. It makes you root for the bad guys for once. Overall it should be on everyone's top ten lists and everyone should watch it. Also, the casting in the movie is phenomenal. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast for someone who has been in prison for ages, he perfectly fits the role of the old dog. Tim Robbins did not receive enough credit for this film. He seamlessly blends into character from an actor. He is cool under pressure, intelligent, and a little bit scary. This movie is probably going to be superior to almost all other films for many years. It is a timeless classic that almost brings you to tears."
321,True,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us."
322,True,"Not what you'd expect, better than what you'd expect. I liked it in many ways, after being told to see it by many people i final watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I now always think of shawshank and pulp fiction as my most favorite films, i have also noticed that they both have rape scenes in them...what a second what does that say about me (not much) . i'm not going to say much about it but i love the ending and i love how you don't think they are going to make it out. for dome reason the film has a lot of rewatchability to it, in the way that there is always a reason to watch it again, as you notice more each time and you see the characters in a different light each time you watch it. or at least thats how i felt watching it."
323,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), andpredicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red."
324,True,"The film The Shawshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne, a prestigious banker ordered to serve time in prison for crimes he was found guilty of, however he claims that he has not committed. The film mainly follows Andy and his ""friends' that he has made in prison around their day to day lives. From working in the prison or what is like to be in your cell by yourself at night, it also follows Andy through his plans and is most definitely brilliant and unbelievable escape.Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is a film about hope and persistence and the rewards for being hopeful and persistent. Throughout this film the main character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) shows that by being persistent and hopeful you can achieve whatever you want. Red (Morgan Freeman) is a character who plays the devil's advocate throughout the film; while he supports Andy and everything he does, he also manages to make it seem like his actions are pointless and a waste of time, however Andy did what he wanted and did not care what others thought, thus reinforcing the theme of persistence. The film uses Brooks (James Whitmore) actions to exemplify the decisions that are made when someone loses hope and does not have the persistence to move forward. The sound effects of this film are key to the added sense of realism and dimensionality of the film. Such as the background noises like small water droplets to the right up front noises like the slamming and locking of the prison cell doors. Other things such as background music are used to set the theme of the movie and the scene currently being viewed, while the background and foreground noises add depth and dimension to the film immersing the viewer and giving the sense of physically being there. Sounds like those of the prison cells, water droplets and the absolute silence of solitary confinement exemplify the theme because to survive all of that you have to have the determination, persistence and hope in order to move forward and survive. The director, Frank Darabont, used the cutting and duration of scenes in order to reinforce the theme and convey the emotions of the film. Such as when there is a dramatic/sad scene the panning is very slow and the scene last for an extended period of time with soft music playing in the background, thus providing the feeling of hopelessness, loss and sadness. On the other hand he also uses this technique to convey happy scenes in the film, such as when Andy's schemes went to plan, the scenes were very bright, usually with upbeat background music and were brightly lit. All in all this movie was done very well and tells the story while trying to immerse the viewer into the film. The story being that by being persistent and hopeful you can improve your always improve your situation and maybe achieve redemption for the wrongs that you have done."
325,True,"Film Appreciation is a course that many college students will take throughout their educational journey in hopes to pass time in an interesting manner while fulfilling an elective. That is my purpose of this review; to fulfill a requirement. However, choosing this film was very deliberate. Upon seeing the list of films to choose on a weekly basis of the course, I knew I would save the best for last. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Giving special care to camera angles, costume design, lighting, transitions, sound effects, and Morgan Freemans god-like voice the creators have produced a film that will stand the test of time. Fulfilling my first requirement I will introduce our notable characters; Tim Robbins plays the mysterious main character Andy Dufresne, next we have the renowned Morgan Freeman playing Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and Bob Gunton starring as the Warden. Each character does an outstanding job making you believe you are experiencing a real-life tale. They possess human-like qualities that are relatable for all which aids in the emotional connection the audience is sure to form with this film. Andy has the will and drive that most people can only hope to possess in their lifetime, while Red is down-to-earth but extremely resourceful. The Warden is cruel, blinded by greed and power which most people in his position would likely succumb to regardless of what they think they would do. These three powerful characters are aided by many background characters who offer humor, softness, or harsh reality. The central theme of this film is that hope exists for all, we just need to never give up enduring life along the way. Peculiar theme to standout in a film encompassing the life of prisoners, but regardless it is my personal take away. We primarily follow the flashback of Andy who is serving two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, but along the way there are other characters who receive special focus in order to evoke unavoidable emotions. We see the different sides of Andy throughout his journey, though much of the time he remains stoic as to not give away key plot points to the audience or even the characters within the film. Given the heavy dialogue and emotion there are many ideas to take- away from this film; you will just have to watch it yourself to experience them all. The most important factors of this film are the use of transitions and sound effects. Since the film takes place over a span of many years it is important to allow the audience to experience the passage of time correctly or the illusion is lost. Changing between slow motion and fast paced transitions, the film layers sound perfectly to the changes whether it is off-screen sound or visible sound made by objects on the screen. Some scenes fade away to aid emotional response, while others flash through quickly in order to give the audience of sense of the effect of the entire action going on in the scene. Combining the believable acting, with an emotional yet oddly- relatable theme and brilliantly done editing/sound effects, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that every person should watch at least once in their life-time (though I recommend more than once to really take it all in). It is a genuine work of art which I will gladly watch any day. (Especially gratifying when it can be used to fulfill a college requirement)."
326,True,"From the opening score that introduced me to the monstrosity known as the Shawshank prison to the visually stunning scene with an amazing score to match as Morgan Freeman strolled alongside the stone wall up to the tall oak tree, every moment was more memorable than the last. This film is not only in an isolated category of movies that define what true filmmaking is, but it is at the top of it. The impact of this film surpasses the average moving going experience so far to the point that it has effected people's lives personally, along with my own. One of the reasons why I decided to become an actor this film will not only live in my heart as the greatest film of all time, but i'm sure in all of the world's as well."
327,True,"Keeping this short and sweet, meek Tim Robbins is a convicted accountant who is sent to a real MEAN prison in Maine. The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called ""the small rewards"" system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in ""Street Smart."" Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence."
328,True,"Perhaps Shawshank didn't take off in popularity until it hit the video market because it is a very intimate and quiet film. The story was too ""personal"" to be viewed in a large theater but best viewed in your pajamas in the privacy of your own home, a place where you could allow yourself to sink completely into the story without being distracted by the nearby sounds of strangers. Stephen King's stories and novels are written with a great deal of inner dialogue and make for difficult adaptation to the screen. This is a beautiful story of struggling in a hopeless and oppresive world, while being unsure of deserving to hope. The scene where Andy played the aria, watching the effect of the soaring music on the faces of even the hardest of the prisoners in the yard, is awe inspiring."
329,True,"The best way to blind someone you have to get closer casually and make them believe you as good friend.(But don't blind somebody who so friendly with you) That's all you good to go ......... Here he's get himself trouble but other side finding a little gap to get into them , when they came to you don't make the first move on you, let them come again, the time if you show a kind or trust in there face make your move , then ........ then ........ you're the one going to decided what to do , or not to do in between some of your tactical move then , you got it ..... wait for it....... wait for it... .. wait for it... .. wait for it... wait for it... the right time comes make the neighbors confuse , make the dog search the wrong place . that's all ........"
330,True,"This film is not just one story. It shows a human being in deeply. It shows the friendship of criminals in jail. Hope is dangerous, but you need it to push you to make something. As the movie say, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies. I love the way to show the story the director did. It is a brilliant and wonderful work. He tries to tell people an objective social phenomenon. The main role tries to break it and throws it away. He wants to have a good life. As the most people think in the world. It pushes people to change our old status. It also make people to have hope and faith. This film is not just one story. It shows a human being in deeply. It shows the friendship of criminals in jail.

331,True,"I never knew that I would like a film about life in a prison but when I saw this one I was so glad that I tried to watch a film about being a prisoner. Tim Robbins played a very good role but I was more entertained by Morgan Freeman who played a very nice person called Red which was a friendly man where you didn't expect from that he was in prison because of killing someone. The film includes some beautiful scenes, for example the scene where Andy Dufresne arranged some beer for some prisoners. From the moment you met the boss of the prison Warden Norton you hate him and you want him to get sacked. Also one of the leaders from the prisoners played by William Sadler is an asshole. The end of the movie was for me a unexpected one. I thought Dufresne wouldn't make it in prison and that he would take suicide. But he escaped and that scene was terrific. And the most beautiful scene for me was the ending of the film where Red and Dufresne met each other in Zihuatanejo. So, this is a brilliant film and unbelievable that this film wasn't a huge success when it was in the cinema. It tells you a true story about life in prison and I suggest everyone to watch this film."
332,True,"This film is one the most emotional and sincere movies on the cinema history. Actually everyone should watch it, and i am sure that everyone can see a lit bit of himself/herself while watching. I cannot think anyone for the supporting actor rather than Morgan Freeman, obviously. Although it seems to be long film, i can assure you that you will go with the flow of the film's atmosphere. Some of the scenes are a little bit offensive but since this is a real time story, we can say that it is OK. Also, thanks to these scenes, mood of the film is much more sincere. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. As i said earlier, everyone can see some of their life's in this movie. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. Everything is much more higher than you expect. So, trust my word and go watch this perfect film.arinc"
333,True,"There is no denying that film is tough to watch, because it is. It showcases the horrible injustices of the American Justice System. However, it is more than this. It is a character-driven film that emphasises how the everyday individual man can respond to imprisonment.Nowhere is this better explored than in the character of Brooks Hatlen. SPOILERSSeeing him become institutionalised and becoming terrified of the world that he has been released into was absolutely heart-breaking. It is a complete tragedy when he kills himself.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about redemption, a story about forgiveness, a story about justice. Watch this film! You will not regret it.Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/3A30Bu"
334,True,"One of the greatest story ever told. One of the most persistent guy ever lived. After watching the movie, I feel the power to continue to our lives whatever happens. Our friend never ever gives up. You need to learn much from him. Greatest escape ever. One step everyday gives the success. It teaches the discipline and persistence on what you do. You can find tiny details makes changes when they are whole. We can call this redemption of life. We need to work with persistence and discipline to achieve the goals that we have. After all we will be free. But the time may come too late. Before it comes to us, we need to pursue it."
335,True,"Best film ! I like so much. Unique !!! But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system."
336,True,"I can honestly say that, even after all these years of being seen on Cable-TV and being sold on D.V.D., ""Shawshank Redemption"" is still the all-time best prison movie I have ever seen, bar-none. In fact, I want to go on record of saying that it's a real shame that it didn't win any or enough Academy Awards, because God knows it deserved to. At the very least Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both deserved a nomination for their performances, because they always put out great performances, now can anyone on this site dispute that, yes or no? And of course I can also comment positively on some of the other actors in the movie: there's Bob Gunton, who portrayed the ruthless and corruptible Warden Norton with such flair; then there's Clancy Brown, whom I remember as Kurgan from 1986's ""Highlander"", who was excellent as Byron Hadley; and of course William Sadler, Col. Stuart from ""Die Hard 2"", was funny as Heywood; Mark Rolston was okay as Boggs; Gil Bellows, who was Tommy who knew the real guy who killed Dufresne's wife and lover and was killed before he could tell anyone else, heck he looked like he did some Elvis Presley impersonating in his time; and let's not forget the legendary James Whitmore, who played Brooksie, enough said there."
337,True,"I wanted to watch for a long time as it had good ratings and is Morgan Freeman's arguably his best performance. In this movie he plays the role of a prisoner inmate known as 'Red' and landed up in the Shawshank jail for murdering a person. Tim Robbins portrays an another falsely accused inmate known as Andry Dufresne. He had been convicted for murdering his wife but in reality he hadn't.The movie meticulously shows Andy's life in prison life. There are many scenes which just stole my heart such as some phrases,etc. One may say it is a bit slow moving and lacks a coherent plot but nah, it was a well written plot. Well it is actually based on Stephen Hawking's novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. Towards the end of the film, Andy Dufresne escapes the Shawshank prison through sheer hard work. He had been chiseling through a well to make up a tunnel. Towards the end, 'Red' ( Morgan Freeman) is acquitted and meets up Andry Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . The cinematography is also good.This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made in the course of movie history. Man, the acting of Morgan Freeman is just too good."
338,True,"A classic from excellent producers. Top quality presentation. Good actors, good budget. Certainly a must watch! From the critics point of view, it took quiet a while for the story to get a direction in the plot (Escape plan). It also took a while to get the characters in place. A certain degree is direction loss with the story concerning the incarceration in the first place. As if there wasn't a great plot to convict, but a need for conviction so that the character is in place. A master piece in concealing details of processes involved. Of course, Morgan Freeman was the highlight in the casting, but William Sadler and Tim Robbins were excellent additions. Set in the earlier 21st Century during the probation years."
339,True,"This movie is brilliant, a completely genius of cinematographic art. The full details of how he can make is run away from the jail is incredible, a major lesson of art are displaced on this movie.When you start watching this movie, you don't's have any idea of what it's going on, and that's awesome, because in the end, you still don't know how it will be, so it creates a spectacular idea of you having no idea of what it is going on...The way that the main character creates to get out of the prison and to ruin the life of it's owner it's just wonderful and leaves the spectator wondering how an only person can do that."
340,True,This Modern day classic is a suspense thriller I've seen this movie a dozen times and can watch over and over again. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are a great duo on screen. Set in in the 60s (Robbins) Andy is convicted of a crime and sent to prison where he is completely out of place. At first he is not received well or welcomed by the other prisoners for his clean looks and appearance. He settles into his surroundings and finds his place while befriending a fellow inmate. Meanwhile he is secretly plotting his escape from prison plan. This movie is one of my personal top ten favorites of all time! I do not want to spoil the ending in case you have not seen this great movie yet. A must see!

343,True,"King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again."
344,True,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."

347,True,"Best film ever made.The movie was gripping from start to finish. Morgan Freeman, was outstanding of his character right through the whole movie. Morgan Freeman, also mad a remarkable statement when he left jail and met up with his friend to be together in freedom. Tim Robbins, was outstanding of his in depth be trail of a innocent man, right throughout another movie.Tim Robbins, his role as setting up the library and doing the guards income taxes then helping a young prisoner do to his exam for school was a wonderful concept for the jail.

348,True,"Intense, exciting, it squeezes the heart and mind is forced to think . After seeing this film, I have decided to make films . I'm an actor and screenwriter thanks to the emotions that gave me . And ' an intense script that runs in this film . Technically I can say I have seen some very important and profound interpretations of the two main characters . And ' a film about freedom, but a sought freedom outside the box. Patience and self-awareness leading to liberation. It is inside of all the power of the cinema, a cinema that should make us reflect objectively , a cinema that is becoming all too often trivial. Follow in the footsteps of this film will be very important in the near future ."

Somehow tunnels through concrete and s**t without anyone noticing. Guy leaves some s**t hidden for other Guy still in prison. Other Guy gets s**t. Some stuff happens in prison between those events. One dude is all emotional and stuff in a rainy scene. uhh what else.. Not much else. Morgan Freeman's character had a hardon for Tim Robbins. I dunno what do you want. This move was lame. Very long too. Could've been 30 minutes tops and still got its ""point"" across. Frank Darabont sucks. The walking dead sucks. The end."
350,True,This movies is beautiful and the best movie ever it is not a movie with high rated is the best because the events in the movie are wonderful and not expected. I think the person who didn't watch this film he didn't watch movies. I don't think that the film is overrated like same people said I think ever one in the world must watch this movie. I don't know why the movie didn't win Oscar he is the best movie ever. In the top 250 movies there are a lots of movies you can find but this movie you will never find in this moment I don't know if there will be a movie high rated or much beautiful like it watch this movie and you will never forget this movie ever
351,True,"Twenty years ago, the movie is already, but there will always be the best movie list to see it, a good thing 1994 film year, several sets of charts in 1994 were released within twenty. Today's movie will put a lot of resources on the sidelines to computer graphics, the importance of fever script, CHANKAI that there is good cause to content, reading aftertaste, again aftertaste. But also want to see the impulse.Shawshank Redemption in prison as the backdrop, the time set in the 1940s, (the actor from jail walls, affixed posters to find he experienced a year) are easy to understand all the dialogue, especially prisoners in prison mood to write very carefully , whether entering the prison on the first day, the first decade, go to the fourth decade, even after leaving prison, has been unable to meet the huge social change, so that the audience can feel it.When this film's most special places, is the use of a large part of the plot to hide the actor Tim Robbins ingenious escape plan! Sheet until the end of the dismantling of truth, can not help but admire, author Stephen King novel layout!Cinematograph James Whitmore (old librarian), live in the prison four years, regardless of the mental body, has been completely dependent on it, so once they are released on parole, as suited to the changes in society, they had embarked commit suicide a way, when you see cause for regret, but it turned out to be an episode of actor Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman worry about life after his release, and after a series of actions, and buried a volt line.Shawshank Redemption was released during the hit ""Forrest Gump"" Forrest Gump then swept the box office and awards, stole the show, Shawshank Redemption has not been much attention. But after the release of the disc, more and more people discuss the film and accumulate excellent reviews, so far is 100 IMDb users voted the best film of the first, CHANKAI think the first is not necessarily the best but at least for a class aimed at fans preferences, remember Forrest Gump in electrical propaganda, with particular emphasis on the effect of her computer, table tennis scene, also put quite a few historical figures pulled into the cinema, which was great selling point. When comparing the two, Shawshank Redemption with a plain expression, not exaggerated special effects, but the theme is always the prison audience empathy is not so heavy, and ""Forrest Gump"" is told from the child's growth from stumble . In the award-winning Hollywood blockbuster with no conditions Shawshank Redemption in 1994, we did not get a lot of people's attention.Shawshank Redemption Frank Darabont is the director's work, I have seen there, ""the Green Mile,"" ""the Mist"", is well worth watching movies.CHANKAI 2016Feb"
352,True,"Watched it 20 years later the release of the flick. And I must say, its among the best Inspirational, Motivational and Uplifting movie I have ever experienced. Was unsure as to why it holds the number one spot in IMDb's title, but now all doubts cleared. People lacking HOPE, Motivation, Self Confidence should see this. It portrays in a good manner as to how a person overcomes Fear in regard of Hope. Go for it blindly and you'll never be disappointed. A man who's being framed wrongly for a crime not committed by him goes to jail. Finds some friends, some allies and some woes. But in the end the route of escape, the hope for a better tomorrow, the will for survival of a man continues. And he continues his fight silently for more than 20 years in silence. Watches all the seasons and festivities and days pass by. Thus, it inspired me a lot on a whole new scale. Even the performance of Morgan Freeman excels, so does he in every movie as usual. The Shawshank Redemption."
353,True,This movie's a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. This movie's really awesome...I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high-adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored.
354,True,"if you haven't seen this already...go right now and watch it and this is as desperate and imp as Gandalf put it best"" Run you fools"". This movie is truly enjoyed when you absolutely have no idea of the plot and I know then why would one watch it but this is just like with its continuously changing plots.. I loved it and it definitely gives you that kick when you are feeling low in life...Wow I truly loved it and I watched this with my best friends. Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself."
355,True,"I think the reason this film stands out a classic is because it has so much heart. I've always thought the story is what makes a great movie, and this one had a brilliant one, based on the short ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. The screenplay adaptation of this short novel elevates the dialog and the moving performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman into a masterpiece. The plot twists and turns in directions that defy the best of imaginations...ones that only Stephen King could write. I am truly humbled by the writing. But as a film it is more than that. It's over-riding theme of ""hope"" transcends the message over the walls of Shawshank to the green grass, and the beaches of Zihuatanejo."
356,True,"""Sometimes I feel sad that Andy is gone. I have to me remember that some birds are not born to cage. its feathers others shine. And when they run away, the part of you that I knew arrest them is a sin, is happy. Yet the place where we live It is more empty and lifeless without them. I think I miss my friend""I'm still wondering how it took me so long to watch this ingenious piece, but okay. Starting with the life lesson about ""Freedom"" that was passed:In the film we have so much to learn about it, we can see that when our freedom is cut unjustly we do not know what to do and everything points in just lowered his head and move on. But no was what Andy did, he had hope but also worked hard to (say around 20 years digging a tunnel? My God, there is perseverance). All this with patience and wisdom (The guy is f ******) And even with all the difficulties, even with all the obstacles of the Director of guards of the rows, and still getting two months in solitary confinement, the guy does not give up.What about hope: Even though every reason in the world to give up, he He did not give up, even when Red said ""Hope can leave a madman ""and he replies:"" Hope is a good thing, maybe the Best of all, and nothing that is good must die ""And even there that hole, he made a difference with their peaceful way, intelligent and both strong and then continued on.On how not learn is in the society:What happened is that the guys were both arrested time already had become accustomed to that reality, for them, it was to be free be trapped inside, the concept of freedom for them changed fully as they surrendered to it and had their freedoms cut, no longer knew what it used to be free and to enjoy to life again. We can see the example of Brooks, there even being arrested, he felt free, he was someone there and built his character there, but unfortunately ended up settling in a lifetime caged and to be returned to their free life, I did not know what to do and He ended up committing suicide. Fortunately it was not what happened with Andy, he He insisted so. Red ended up bending a little, but in the end with the help of his friend, entirely given your life back.This film is a great lesson. It is something to be taken to heart and take as an example for life. Everything about him, the construction of the script, develop the story, the flawless performances, was something millimeter worked, and think, worked very well. The characters are extremely catchy, since its characteristics to his dialogs, which are very rich, very intelligent and were used an excellent narrative. This movie made me have a roller coaster of emotions, from ups and downs, to laugh, to cry but also be moved. Anyway, all I can say is Andy and Red did give me a wide grin that lasted one hour and after the movie and I went to sleep happy. 5-star favorite, great masterpiece lives up to all excellent reviews and the excellent grades he deserves."
357,True,"An ultimate master-piece. The best movie ever made. Period.There are movies, there are great movies and then at the end of the tunnel, there is SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Initially, a failure at box office but a winner of hearts and emotions forever. This movie changes life, it helps people get eternal hope. The strength of the movie is its connection with the audience. One can easily relate with a scene or a character or a moment in this gem of a movie.Shawshank Redemption is a movie which strikes a chord with all its viewers. Two words that define this movie are: Hope and Friendship. It shows the ever-lasting bonding of 2 men and their journey together in the confines of a prison. The simplicity of the movie is admirable. The scenes are believable, the struggles are realistic and one gets attached to the pain and sufferings of Andy Dufresne. All the characters have done an incredible work. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) carry the movie and are outstanding to say the least.Whenever you feel sad or upset, whenever you need hope or whenever you want some will to overcome the greatest obstacle, Shawshank Redemption will uplift you in ways that just cannot be simply described in words. It will touch your soul and leave you mesmerized, captivated and wanting for more. You will definitely identify something very personal in your own life.I personally use the quotes in this movie in my real life. They help me whenever I feel depressed. 1.Fear can keep you prisoner, Hope can set you free. 2.Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. 3.Get busy living, or get busy dying. 4.On the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.It is my all-time favorite. I have watched it more than 30 times and still the charm fails to fade away. Every time it leaves me spellbound with its sheer brilliance. It gets better with every showing. The movie connects with you, it moves you and most importantly, it gives you HOPE!!!"
358,True,"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Now, I see what everybody was talking about.

359,True,"Shawshank Redemption showcases the best elements of human endurance. The justice involved in both sides of the fence is heavily weighted towards human dignity. It is still valid today as we look at men and women enduring prison and racial injustices involving the treatment of black prisoners. This comes out in Morgan Freeman's performance and the reactions to his parole hearings.Tim Robbin's performance, shows the utter joy and excitement of beating the system in his expressions during the record scene, and the arrival of the library. The writing and dialogue show intelligence behind the conversations of those whom are usually found to be marginalized. The character development of Red and his friends is absolutely astonishing as they play off of and rely on the validity of Tim Robbins pulling off a truly amazing performance. The Bad guy: is always hard to write about. But he did good making us hate him, whatever that may entail, bless him. The cruel scenes are depicted with horror, while withdrawing dignity from the character's card pile; and turning it over to the viewer. You can crawl into their skin, but won't need therapy. The movie IS therapy."
360,True,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
361,True,"I saw this movie the first feeling that you will try to not feel the same person. The banker Andy Dufresne, masterfully played by Tim Robbins, is accused and punished by ergs for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover. He will be sent to Shawshank Prison, where he is director of Norton, whose corruption leads to the use of convicts to be able to enrich. In this prison, much like a hell, Andy will find support as Red, Morgan Freeman in his best performance but only earned him a nomination for an Oscar. The result is a strong friendship between the two, so much so that, for the persecuted Andy, Red becomes like an island of sanity in a sea of ​​sharks who take advantage of him. But here is the teaching of the film, grown because your passions will redeem you, and you always have hope because hope is perhaps the best thing for a man! The intelligence of Andy and his hope will allow it to redeem himself and save a life ... that of Red. The considerer one of the best films in cinema history and a must see for review. I am surprised, but not that much, why did not win anything really important ... is considerable an injustice like the absurdly missed Oscar for Best Picture in Taxi Driver, 2001 Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange, Awakenings, and Kane to the directors M. Scorsese, S.Kubrick and O.Welles!"
362,True,Thia is the Best Movie of Prison Escape Ever in my view as of its suspense & drama before they even escape with showing technical ways of brilliant mind ..... MOrgan freeman showing his Class as Always .... with exceptional camera work of close cell scenes ..... Best Location & Escaping route ..... Credit to sound producer as well as casting directors for amazing supportive cast not even making minor mistakes .... Good thing not showing extreme make ups as it was less action & more drama type .... I Personally love it because it was released on my birthday exactly ON birthday ...... heads off to director & producer for coming up with the best team for best movie.
363,True,"WARDEN NORTON: I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.RED: I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.ANDY: I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.WARDEN NORTON: Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind!RED: Same old sh*t, different day.CAPTAIN HADLEY: What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?BROOKS: Easy peasy japanesey.RED: I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.ANDY: Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.ANDY: You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? RED: No. ANDY: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.RED: I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."
364,True,"Perhaps Not to the liking of some of this great achievement, this achievement deserves to be the best ever in each side of this film is fun cannot find a description of the film may be the amounts in the Praise but for the sake of this film is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema.The total of the scenes that make you a shock of the genius of the output and montage of the crew of the entire technical creativity does not ultra in this work is difficult to compare between him and any other movie I see that deserves to be ranked as it is.The role played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as if the fact and not the representation of the wonder of creative mind delicious j they have done in this film either by the end of others never commission that may be the best in the history of art is indeed one of the greatest ends that could be seen a follower."
365,True,Best movie ever.Tim Robbins acting is exquisite and Morgan Freeman's narrating is mesmerizing.How Stephen King can create such a story is beyond me.I love how you almost feel like a part of the prison family Andy and Red has and how you get to follow them. You also get to understand how an ex-con tries to adopt to a life on the outside after spending their whole life behind bars.What I disliked with the movie was that I felt a particular plot point was thrown together in haste but after that the movie resumes to it's 10/10 stars standard.
366,True,"This movie is just amazing. Star cast, superb photography, brilliant achievement, and a spectacular argument. It's one of those movies that make only far away, and never forget. I've seen him several times and I miss him a lot of people. How can a man so apparently weak and without energy and character, have survived so many years to dream, never giving up on a dream, having endured so many hardships, a battering, raped, etc. And yet he gave hope to his jail mates, let alone its true friends. And the end .. could take revenge on everyone, especially the chain director. Conclusion is an excellent film in every respect, should never be overlooked nor see, ever."
367,True,"At a port town, a crowd of passengers disembarks from a steamboat; among them, a grizzled cowboy with a gun at his hip. Two lawmen escort him out.Newsie: Extra, extra, health benefits of smoking! Extra, extra, read allabout...hey! Watch it, mister!The cop had shoved him aside.Newsie: Extra, extra! Bill Williamson's gang...They walk out of range, ending up at Blackwater Station. The cowboy gets on the train without speaking a word, and takes a seat as the steam engine leaves town. Two ladies behind him, and a young lady and a preacher in front of him, hold their own conversations.Lady: Well, I for one am grateful, Mrs. Bush, that they are finally bringingcivilization to this savage land.Mrs. Bush: I could not agree with you more, my dear. My daddy settled thisland and I know he'll be looking down on us, pleased at how wehelped the natives.Lady: Yes they've lost their land, but they've gained access to heaven.John listens to the young lady and the preacher in the seat ahead of him.Jenny: But Father, do you mean unless an innocent receives communion, they'redestined to go to hell? That hardly seems fair.Father: What I mean to say, Jenny, is that there is a great deal of differencebetween an innocent and a savage.Jenny: I never thought of it that way.Lady: Yes they live like animals. But they're happier now.Jenny: Not only do people now have motorcars, father, but I heard pretty soonwe will be able to fly.Father: No, angels can fly, Jenny.Jenny: No, no, apparently people can fly. Didn't you hear? Out in Kansas a maneven got a car to fly."
368,True,"I am not well enough equipped to explain just how much I love this film. I have long since lost count of the times I have watched it from beginning to end. Though some of the film's content can make for difficult viewing, there is such a richness in the story that I just haven't seen anywhere else. The characters are brilliantly written and though they all have their serious flaws, you can imagine the friendship and experiences they share as if they are your own. The ending of the film is ridiculously uplifting and the music throughout the film is absolutely beautiful. This film will make you laugh, cry and smile in equal measure. A truly unforgettable experience that will leave it's mark on me until the day I die I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it. If you have seen it then maybe it's time you go watch it again!"
369,True,"A story of friendship and endurance set in the reality of prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is best known as an Oscar-nominated film. However, this theatre production is based instead on the original novella written by Stephen King relatively early in his career.The direction in this piece is stylised, with a deliberate slow rhythm and pace, particularly in the first act, greatly reducing any sense of menace that you would expect from this so-called tough prison. It is almost Brechtian in style. This becomes frustrating as it takes much of the emotion out of the production; a vital piece of the human connection that then means the audience is less invested in the outcome of the possibly innocent Andy Dufresne and the lovable rouge Red. This underplaying of emotion results in a restrained and difficult to engage with character in Dufresne, played by Ian Kelsey. There are moments of anguish from Kelsey, but with the direction holding such a tight reign on the characters, the moments are too far and between. Patrick Robinson's Red fares a little better as he addresses the audience with a charming older storytelling voice, but is still not given enough freedom to truly embrace Red's charisma. When using this deliberate stylised direction, the impact on the reality of the stage fighting also showed, again detracting from the idea of brutality.The second half picks up the pace slightly and the play overall is watchable with good performances all round from the cast. However, without the rawness derived from emotional context, the prison life never feels as if it is unbearable to be in or watch, meaning the power of the ending is lessened.By Isabella Fraser"
370,True,"First of all, the actors chosen to play the key roles were absolutely suitable and fitted each other. More specifically, Morgan Freeman is remarkable. In addition, the direction of the movie was flawless. Excellent Photography! Furthermore, the music was stunning. Wonderful sounds to accompany this epic film. Concerning the story, it was really touching. From the beginning of the film, you get stuck in front of the screen to watch every single scene. You travel in a world of anxiety, pain and ultimate redemption. I love this film so much because of the perfect combination of all the fundamental elements. It is almost certain that you will get emotionally attached with all the characters. To sum up, The Shawshank Redemption is a movie you should watch. It is totally a piece of art."
371,True,"Cinematography just isn't what it used to be. This movie is not only my personal favorite but also the favorite of the approximate 1.5 million people who have rated this title. The way that this film is made cannot be rivaled by today's standards. The writing, the acting, the scenery, etc combine to make this possibly the best movie that will ever be made. I don't think that this will ever be matched.I have seen Shawshank about 100 times, this is no joke. Every time I watch it I feel the same way that I did when I watched it for the first time. It will never get old. Every time I watch this I begin to sympathize with Andy and enjoy watching his friendship with Red grow. I am in complete awe until the closing credits begin to roll.I sincerely believe that no one can match the power of the Shawshank Redemption."
372,True,"This movie is so good that words can't possibly be enough to explain its awesomeness. It starts out on a pretty dark note with killings and crime but as the story progresses we see how crime or rather criminals is not always simply black or white, its layers of Grey one cannot objectively see but only feel. We see how the lead character Andy Dufresne grows as a human, accompanied by Morgan Freeman or as people call him "" Red "", his voice sounds like liquid gold. Over the movie you will feel many things, happy would be one of them but wait for that moment because when you finally reach the point where Morgan Freeman is telling you about the Blue of the Pacific and the camera pans out to the ocean, it will be all worth it in the end."
373,True,"This is my first review here, and i'm glad it's about Shawshank Redemption. What I really loved about this movie is how a man with sheer determination can accomplish even far-fetched goals. It also shows how to pick ourselves up when we are at our lowest. The movie also highlights friendship.I think Red's friendship with Andy is the very thing that kept Red from ending up like Brooke. I really loved the part when Red said ""I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him"". Overall, it really is a masterpiece and deserves the top position."
374,True,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle."
375,True,"This is one of the best movies i ever saw. For sure in top 5 movies in history. Actors are so good, you think everything is real. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Strong story, act is on high level. My favorite actor is Morgan Freeman so you can think how i'm happy that he is the one acting in this movie. If you watch this, you will enjoy every second of it. Pefect movie for family night. I would watch this every day. The plot for this film is very unique, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. It is the sort of film that will keep you guessing as to what will happen next and it was just a very interesting concept overall."
376,True,"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice- over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two."
377,True,"I'm not a professional critic, so I will put it the simplest way I can. This movie is one of those movies you keep coming back to every few years and watch again. It will never get old either.The prison represents life itself, the lives we were born to at least, and it tells us another life is possible out there and for that we must be able to break out of the life we are born to. The film shows the birth, maturation and re-birth of a person who does not belong to the society at large. In the final the man is reborn in mud, filthy just like before, but this time he is going to live the life he chose."
378,True,"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times."
379,True,"I am at a loss of words to describe the greatness of this film, and by all means I give full credit to the book that it is an adaptation of.Half way through the film I began to enjoy the capabilities of the man and begin to see all that as the point of the film, but then it slows down in pace a bit (for the final ""assault"") and I end up asking myself the purpose of it all, but then the ending leaves me speechless!This film, alongside the Bollywood biopic 'Manjhi - The Mountain Man' (2015), are two great examples of the fact how time is of little value when there are no better alternatives to achieve your goal. Often in our life we deny to take certain steps which might help us in achieving a goal in some years, but exactly after spending as much time sitting mum, we reflect on the time spent and regret not having taken those steps in all these years.A maternal cousin of mine from Denmark visited us in the summer of 2012 and he mentioned this film in a lot of conversation. Sadly, I wasn't too much into Hollywood films yet. Now that I am since over 15 months I checked the IMDb list of top 250 films and found this on the first place. I was immediately reminded of my cousin and thought that he wasn't after all just randomly naming a film. It was very clever to have shown Andy as innocent. This makes the viewers get more engaged into his suffering in the prison. The scene where he goes to his room with the rope, you almost find yourself saying in heart how this will be great injustice and something very, very sad and depressing.Again, all in all, this film is out of this world. One of the best of all times."
380,True,"A little anal rape and before you know it, you've made a martyr of a man. Good martyr though, except that he stays alive through out the entire movie. Well told in classic Morgan Freeman style but Shawshank redemption, whilst being a very fine example of Cinema, is lacking in much. It is very tense and dramatic but simple in it's premise, innocent man will escape from jail. In between are an abundance of clichées and well used jail house scenarios, as seen in many other lock up romps. The difference with Shawshank is how polished everything is. It's not a surprise when Frank Darabont is behind a helm. He has proved to cast well and have perfect characters execute a story to the most professional of levels. I think that the movie would have been better if they had been following Red and Andy get's busted when Red comes meets him in the sandy finale. Maybe executed by FBI and Red was involved in the sting operation. you may not agree."
381,True,In this fantastic movie people who was innocent figure out himself to be free man.And people who can't afford to live without friends and strong enough to be fixed with world.The man who tried to get back his life.The only word for this movie was powerful.Prisoners were need to get help from us .To survive in the wild world you have to strong.Morgan Freeman has excellent skills.Director was the best of times over the years.However it was deserved to win Oscar.The people who made this movie were be memorial.This will make your mind to think about life and people who are fighting for their lives.Great thanks for letting me to be watched this movie.Good for us to take the time of feeling.
382,True,"Great movie and highly recommended for anyone seeking a Monte Cristo type story. Set up for murder. Sent to prison for life. Agony and loneliness is evident. Found life thru knowledge for education. Friends and loyalties were made. Hope came and was squashed. That leads to anger and action. Friends worry without knowledge of future of protagonist. Hope is obtained for more than just the protagonist. Great for people whom like; biographies, emotional, male bonding, facing obstacles, seeking hope of the future, prison life, life building skills, justice prevailing, getting even with those whom treat people horribly, creating something good in a bad situation."
383,True,"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time."
384,True,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
385,True,"its a movie on prison break. we all seen the season prison break. it has 3 seasons. but, this movie has only 2 hrs. classic movie. i rated 10/10. i also like escape plan which is also on prison break. but this movie is different. i like this movie very much. director feel us hero was not guilty so he comes out from prison...and live his life happily...with his friend in prison.... i listed this movie in must seen movies before you die...see my list....""MUST SEEN MOVIES BY MANDLI""and......also...a note.. i write this review this long and long because review says ""your review does not contain enough lines -the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text"
386,True,"Hands Down The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen... Shocked By The Ending.... Deserves 10/10 First I Thought The Movie Was Not That Good As Its A Flop Movie, But When I Watched It I Honestly Gotta say The best movie made till now. Their are certain moments when u get bored but the ending totally changes the way u thinking. Morgan Freeman is at its best. Tim Robbins is the master of the movie And no word for the warden he is too good Truly a masterpiece. Amazing movie, one of my three favorites! I could watch it 100 times and it would never get old. Though there is a couple of scenes with violence and sexual dialogue. Language throughout."
387,True,"20 years ago in college, the students dropped out due to encounter, depressed, so watch the movie together, the film Andy's experience, giving not give up, and give courage, the moment there is a way to face everything is every 20 years, whenever difficulties, think of Andy, and the courage to face the deep impact of the film, no wonder it can be used as the first 100 big movie !! In any case, people who have not seen the movie, is a loss, almost every year to re-read once, often have a harvest.Whether the movie is a great story, and the music class, acting class, almost can not find a picky.The movie can be said is a classic classic inside, almost never heard of people do not like this movie."
388,True,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever."
389,True,"Shawshank has everything you need from a movie.Cinematography and direction, both combine to make the film something unique.This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.Freeman, a wonderful actor, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his perfect playing.I read elsewhere this ""if you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption"". Well I do agree completely.I never, ever, ever heard from a friend of mine who I recommended it that he had not liked it."
390,True,"The Shawshank Redemption (1994): Dir: Frank Darbont / Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, William Sadler: Gripping film about finding refuge in a place of despair. Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10"
391,True,"I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, ""This is just right!"" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again"
392,True,"One of my all time favorite movies. Although there's not much action, the plot and acting pulled me in. Throughout the movie the suspense keeps building and building with everything happening to Andy you just feel bad for him. It all leads up to him escapping which he rightfully deserves to.Clearly Tim Robins was devoted to his role as Andy Dufresne. The way he stays in the same exact character through the whole movie is impressive. He always has a mild composure with little outbursts of anger and rage which I think he uses perfectly. Morgan Freeman as ""Red"" was impressive as always. Taking almost the mentor role for Andy to help him get through being in a jail until finally escapping."
393,True,"I found it amazing and unique film , is the perfect movie and I do another movie exceeded, the performances are great as are the actors and producers which can be noticed that gave freedom to the director to make the film as wanted why you can really see how the director planted his idea in the movie and you can also notice the effort that used on stage and in the locker room that gave a kind of reality to the film which caused the people who saw they feel identified with the story and characters. The actors act in the best possible way which gives it a unique and memorable touch to the film and its characters which always carry in our memory for its history in jail and obstacles by crossing the characters."
394,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur.

From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."

397,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
398,True,"A movie worthy of the label, 'very good'  but being number one out of all movies ever? No way, are you kidding me? One should go back to snacking on those wacky mushrooms  please. Better yet let us all have some, those hallucinations need to be shared by one and all. It was a good movie...very good in fact. And without question, this is some quality entertainment. I really did enjoy the one time I saw it. I have to say though, I did not wet myself with glee when I watched the flick. It just seemed like the plot was far-fetched and a bit tiresome. The premise of good triumphing over evil is outstanding. It is too bad that the action of defining good and evil is clearly sitting outside the reality-room in 'Redemption.' 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Prison guards = bad and hardened criminals = bad? Why? I can understand Tim Robbins latching his wagon to this ridiculous notion  but Morgan Freeman? Sorry it just doesn't compute. For me  a very good movie  but not a great movie. I will give this ""King"" drama an 8/10"

401,True,"Andy, who is a young and successful banker, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. This movie revolves around the events in his life from when he comes to prison till he escapes from it. This the one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best message conveyed by this movies is of eternal hope. Andy was sent to the prison though he didn't commit the crime. Over the years, he retains hope and earns the respect of fellow prisoners, especially he bond with a longtime convict, Red. Over the time, Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison, leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned. And finally he escapes from the prison and frees himself. This movies truly depicts the meaning of the quote ""Hope is a good thing maybe the best thing, and no good things ever dies""."
402,True,"i love this each time i watch..i just love each and every character in this movie..quite inspiring the most imp thing is this movie was done in 1994 and at that time the director did such type of awesome work with the story and for that i hats up for his work..the acting is really nice from each and everybody..the most imp part is when its revel the big hole..omg the turning point of the movie and then the narration part of andy and then the post card received by freeman and then he release from the jail and then he go to the same house where the ex librarian hang himself and freeman couldn't do that and he is on his towards hope and they meet each other. "" HOPE IS A GOOD THING MAY BE THE BEST OF THINGS,AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIE """
403,True,"When the odds are against you, there's only moving forward or turning back. When Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to one of the toughest prisons for two consecutive life sentences for murders he did not commit, the mere thought is enough to make anyone insane. Prison life is tough, but Shawshank prison gets the cake for displaying just how harsh it can be. Corrupt guards, brash punishments and bare minimum accommodations are only half the picture. Just as soon as he's about to break, he makes a discovery that requires incredibly true determination and hope. The Shawshank Redemption is a screenplay adaptation of Stephen King's novella; Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Writer and Director Frank Darabont was able to capture a realistic representation of what prison life might have looked like in the first half of the 20th century. Although the budget was very modest for this film, it really looks like they didn't need anymore. A cast that consists of veteran actors helps to meld the film's respect with their performances. One very noteworthy performance was from Morgan Freeman's character: Ellis Boyd (Red). He was also the one who narrated most of the film and that's always a treat for the audience.Thomas Newman who was responsible for the soundtrack did a great job enhancing the scenes whether it is eerie or joyous. Although at times I felt that there needed to be a more powerful theme to reflect the scene which fortunately was only in a few scenes. Nevertheless, the captivating themes are something to remember in this film. Memorable characters, a great soundtrack and an excellent plot all make this a highly recommended movie to watch. There really isn't much to nit-pick about this film which is what really brings it to the top. Like all highly rated/regarded films, there tends to be some form of overrating which is understandable, since all great things attract jealousy."
404,True,"The fact this movie stands at the IMDb top for years now should be enough to convince you to watch this asap. Based on a novella by Stephen King, Frank Darabont's film is perhaps the most accomplished prison drama ever. If you liked Papillon, you are going to love Shawshank's Redemption. But this is more than just a bleak prison drama. Not that there aren't grim situations depicted here. Several points in the story are not for the faint of heart for their cruelty and outright sense of injustice. The ordeals of one Andy Dufresne (in an unsurpassed performance by Tim Robbins) and his fellow cell mates are in fact so harrowing that will make you beg for justice to be done and pray for salvation. Is there hope and light at the end of the tunnel? Let's say that this movie belongs to that group of films (like Sixth Sense and Jacob's Ladder) that have a little secret and when the time for catharsis comes, after all the trials our hero has been through, it doesn't just rain, it pours. It is that precise moment that turns what would have otherwise been a finely crafted drama into a timeless classic. As the protagonist at one point says, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things. And it is hope that fuels this expertly told tale of fight against adversity and why this film resonates so strongly with so many people."
405,True,"SR is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It's story is about a man who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sentenced for life in prison . After twenty years of great troubles in the prison he escapes from the prison by much hard working and patience. Then he lives happily ever after overseas. Movies background displays the life in prison, it highlights innocent people in the prison. Even they did bad things they deserves redemption. But not all of them. Some deserve punishment, some deserve freedom. It isn't easy to choose who deserves what. This also shows the corruption in authority. They only care about money. They doesn't care about lives of the inmates. For example the fat guy who cries in his first night gets killed by guards. If the authorities care about lives of inmates they should punish the responsible for it. But they don't even raise a question."
406,True,"Yet I could not watch the movie , but it seems to me the story pleases me a lot. I'll do with the maximum attention. I hope not disappoint me this production.I was Recommended As such hope and what is in the agreement with the opinion of my colleague. Never had listen talk in "" The Shawshank Redemption of (1994 ) "" but I liked In this prefecture.I am pretty addicted to series and recommend The Vampire Diaries , I found this fabulous series . Watch and not go wrong."
407,True,"This is a lovely movie and a must watch for all the Classical movie lovers out there. There's pinch of emotions that comes bundled with the movie and you eventually get involved in the movie so much that it's hard for you to decide who is the right man. In short, life is easiest when you learn the right way to live it.The movie comes with quite a lot twists and suspense scenes. At the end it'll be hard for you to believe. Won't reveal much about the movie - but if you're a movie freak and you're the person who is turned on with classical tales, this is the one for you. At the end of the movie I'm pretty sure that you'll have a different perspective towards life and people around you. Do watch it."
408,True,"The Shawshank Redemption.A film about an innocent and hopeful banker named Andy Dufrense, who gets wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover she cheated him with. He befriends a charming yet fearful fellow inmate named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. The two men bond for 19 years in Shawshank prison from 1947 to 1966. They work hard, find solace, earn the respect of the other prisoners, and eventually redeem themselves by escaping. All by committing acts of common decency. There's a reason why this movie is number one on the top 250 movies of the IMDb. There is only one word that can describe a film like this. Perfect! This film is perfect in every shape, way, and from. The directing, writing, acting, story, plot, characters, visuals, lighting, atmosphere, pacing, technicals, editing, and even the music is all perfect. It's fully enjoyable from start to finish. Not once did I take my eyes off the screen or stopped listening for a sec. Heck, even the casting and believability in this film is perfect. Each and every actor fits their character perfectly and the film is entirely flawless. There was not one moment in the entire film that I pointed out a plot hole, or a continuity error, or anything. The best part about this film is the impact the story has on the viewer, because this film has the most satisfying and perfect ending ever in film history. It will leave the viewer with the best feeling ever. It's a timeless film that can be watched countless times over again and never gets tiring. It's rather unbelievable that this film didn't win a single Oscar. Luckily, this film doesn't need an Oscar to know that it's the best film ever, it just needs the general public. What's even more unbelievable is that this is the first movie that director Frank Darabont made and it's based off of the Stephen King novella. Now, I never read the book, but I can already bet that this film is even better than the book and that's saying a lot. This film can even go so far as to be therapeutic. If anyone out there is reading this and is feeling depressed, please watch this heavenly film and be uplifted. The moral of this movie is a moral that speaks for all movies that helps a character get through their darkest times and it is a moral that can help anyone in real life get through their darkest times. Remember it and never forget it. Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free."
409,True,"One of the best movies ever made. Morgan Freeman is like always best playing a role, he is magnificent. In my opinion Tim Robbins makes one of his lifetime roles here as well. As the plot says ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" but this movie is actually more than that. I do not want to ruin pleasure of watching so enjoy it as much as you can. Also in my opinion this movie was the foundation for other good movies, one of that being Inception that has ""some"" of the Shawshank Redemption ideas inside . In my opinion this can be called the beginning of a new era in cinematography history as it records new (for the time) approaches on movies and acting (see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) . Also, this movie is one of the new plan to save Hollywood movie industry at the time as Hollywood was almost deep buried in clichés and bad producing and acting movies. Just to shorten it up i am speechless and please watch, enjoy and have a nice experience.Thank you for reading my review , hope i managed to catch you and please stay tuned."
410,True,"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library."
411,True,"Best movie I've ever seen in quite a long time. it has everything. intrigue until the last minute, passionate and heartbreaking story.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle."
412,True,"This movie blow my mind, i love the character of Andy and his friend Red, i like the he overcome his problems and keep in mind his goal freedom. Love how he make all the plan to brake out form jail. i think is really cool the as always all runaways go and hide in Mexico. Like the idea of going to Zihuatanejo beach and build a ship and go travel all pacific Mexican cost. Andy was a really Smart man and i think this move shows how you can pass all bad things in life if you have a goal, and look for it. The only i didn't like was the fact the nobody prove the Andy was Innocent of killing his wife. or maybe he did, i think Andy find out the she was cheating on him and he plan the crime with the same method he plan his scape of prison, who knows?"
413,True,"Wow, this is really the best movie ever made. Even though this movie contained a few mistakes, I'd like to rate it full-on-full. I want to tell this to all the people who haven't seen the movie, it's a must watch. You might think that 'Forrest Gump', The Best Picture Oscar winner can beat it, let me tell you, IT CANNOT! I'm serious! It is about a man, Andy Dufresne who has been put behind the bars for the murder of his wife and her lover, a Professional Golf player. But just like every other man in The Shawshank Prison, he too is innocent. Then he meets a, Ellis Boyd Redding, a smuggler/businessman and makes friends with him and his gang. Andy then asks him for a small rock hammer witch is soon delivered to him. He one day sees the names of prisoners written in the cell. He to goes to writ his name on the wall that is so weak that is comes out after which, he starts digging a hole in the wall. After 20 years of being in the jail and realizing how corrupt the warden is when he kills his friend, he escapes the prison and gets the warden so good that he suicides. The last thing that I'd like to say is that it should be rated 9.5 on IMDb but still, that's just a suggestion. 9.3 is good."
414,True,"Never has a movie inspired me so. The actors shine, the story is compelling, and the directing is incredible. Frank Darabont truly outdid himself with this masterpiece.Tim Robbins' is truly convincing as Andy Dufresne, in a role that would truly define his career. We see an innocent man thrust into an unfair situation, who maintains hope to keep himself moving and that hope itself will become contagious. Morgan Freeman steels the show as Red, his partner in crime. Freeman brings to this film a sense of thoughtfulness, a sort of diamond in the rough that is prison. He may not be perfect but he is wise, no man could have pulled off this role quite like Freeman did. Too much do we forget Bob Gunton in the role of the sinister Warden Samuel Norton. We are both terrified and disgusted by him as he skirts the law and abuses his inmates in an effort to stay at the very top.The violence and the nature of some of the inmates is worth noting as it portrays prison accurately. In films like Cool Hand Luke we see how these chain gang members are portrayed as sort of good old boys who merely made a mistake. With characters like Boggs Diamond we receive a visceral reminder of what prison life is really like, and we accompany Andy on his ride through it. The plot twist is elaborate and clever, like I would expect from a Steven King novella. It floors you and leaves you at the edge of the seat. In the end, you can not help but feel happy, joyous, and hopeful.This is a must see before you die. An inspirational movie that will leave you spellbound for days. It is more than a film, it an experience of a lifetime."
415,True,"Movie/Film is called shadow of life or imagination. We watch for entertainment or learning or just for fun. All movies can't achieve the goal to satisfy its viewer but ""The Shawshank Redemption (1994)"" does beyond expectation. Those who fade up with their life should must watch The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Its a movie of inspiration. After watching the movie you realize it deserve the No.1 movie of IMDb top movies of all the time. Without watching the Review can't express its beauty. I've watches more than thousand movies but its the best. Still waiting for a movie in which I can give 10 out of 10. It got 9 form me but its my highest rating."
416,True,"I really liked this move and this is why my first review it's about it. First time I saw it, I was maybe 12, and even then, I was fascinated with it. A story of a life spent in prison and learning how to live with it, not giving up even everything seems lost, it was just breathtaking. The second time I saw it, I was a bit older and understood it better. I won't write about acting or the technical things but the movie as a whole. It is in deed a masterpiece. Only a few movies can say about themselves that everything was alright and if anything were different, it would't be such a great film."
417,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a film that plays out the story of Red's, Morgan Freemans, experiences, encounters, and friendships while imprisoned for murder. Red begins with his first encounter of Andy Dufresne, Tim Robbins. Andy was quit peculiar in the way in which he carried himself and his quietness, which intrigued Red. Andy requested a rock hammer from Red, from then on Andy and Red's friendship began to grow. The film shows the hardships prisoners experience, including being jumped and raped by the ""Sisters."" But the film also displays what good can be done within the prison, such as Andy, an experience banker, volunteering to do taxes and give financial advice to the guards in return for a better life behind bars for him and his friends. Andy uses his privilege to rejuvenate the prison's library and offering assistance to prisoners to obtain there high school equivalency. The film is spanned out over 40 years, showing the long term sentences these men have served. There are several themes as work in this film, but the most prominent one is the power of hope. Throughout the movie, glimmers of hope are expressed by the men but then soon shattered. The beginning scene of the bet of which ""New fish"" would cry was soon realized to be cruel and led to a prisoner's death. Throughout the movie, Red (Freeman) had lost all hope. Red displayed this loss of hope with his uncaring attitude displayed at his parole hearings. He had no motivation to express to the board that he was a changed man and was ready to return back to society. He said the same speech at almost every hearing which lead to his denial until he later regained hope for a brighter future and spoke of his regret to the parole board. Hope was also displayed through music, the singing French woman and the harmonica. A glimmer of hope was displayed for Red when his friend escaped prison, this hope grew when he was unexpectedly granted parole. Through Red's narrative, it seemed as his Red's fate was to be the same as Brooks, ""Institutionalized,"" but Red prevailed and pursued his long lost friend, Andy. The letter that Andy left for Red under the lava glass near the oak tree stated, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" This changed Red, he now understood the saying ""Either get busy living, or get busy dying,"" and he chose life. Symbols used throughout the film were rocks and pinup posters of iconic women. Rocks were used ultimately to hide the true purpose of the rock hammer, but they were also a symbol of hope and normalcy. The posters of the iconic women, such as Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe, were posters to cover up Andy's true desire which was to escape this unjust imprisonment and return to his normal life. An example of good sound effects is the scenes leading up to Brooks' demise. The sound effects create a sense of understanding and realism; soft music is played as her narrates his final letter to his friends back at prison. Shots of the hustle and bustle of the city, cars whizzing by and honking at Brooks, the noisy and bossy grocery manager. In the final scene of him committing suicide, the noise of his pocket knife is very prominent and creak of the chair as he mounts it to carve his name in the rafter, and the sound of the chair being kicked away and the tension on the rope is heard. This is very realistic and somber. The music is soft which created an emotion of sadness and does not drown out the important subtle noises. A movie that shares some of the same themes and motifs is Green fried Tomatoes, this film portrays a significant amount of time and displays the power of hope as well. In conclusion, this film displays the power of hope and how it effects people when hope is lost. Andy's unwavering hope brings ""light"" to others around him, possibly saving their lives."
418,True,"As far as I am concerned, I think it is a movie well worth watching. I am a senior high school student in China, and I really do not have lot of time to lead a free life as most of students abroad (stated in many books and stories in China). As is known to many people, there exists a strict examination (The National College Entrance Exam) in China, and each student only have one chance to attend it during his/her lifetime, so nobody will give it up and everyone is fighting for it.Just like Andy, Red and many other people in the Shawshank. Maybe most of us living creatures do not have a real freedom.It is a jailbreak story in many people's eyes, but it isn't just like that in my aspect. I regard it as a kind of redemption as the title of the movie. As is stated in Oxford Dictionary, ""REDEMPTION"" is ""the action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil"" or ""a thing that saves someone from error or evil"". In my opinion, both of its meaning was highlighted.I do not want to talk about this movie from performance, even if it is the soul of a movie. But I think there must be a more important thing.Red is a man lost his heart, even if he is always speaking ill of the guard, his eyes is like a silent street, he can bear anything, and he will not have a quarrel, he sentenced himself to death. Though he said he had been totally changed in the jail, nobody would like to APPROVE him of get out of it. But when he tell them his true words inside his heart, he was soon set free. It is just like a kind of joking, but I think it is of high applause. I don't know how to express it in an exact word in English, it means ""血性"" in Chinese.As for Andy, the other main character in this movie. He is an energetic bird looking forward to freedom, which is wise enough as well. Carving the wall, behind which is freedom. It takes him nineteen years. But it is fair. In his past life, though he was freer than that in Shawshank, he was also trapped. Trapped by his daily routines, by his wife's abandon or by those business and title he earned. For many of us, one should work until his sixties or older, and when he could enjoy his life, there is not very much left exactly. Andy used nineteen years to gain a freedom, and he got it faster than we.Maybe the western cannot get my idea, but in fact, a people in China even need to work in his seventies. There are thousands of rooms left empty, but most of people cannot have their own house in his whole life. That is the reason why I am longing for freedom.Owing to the blessing of the god, I have my own house with my family, we have cars. What's more, we do not have trouble in earning a living. Maybe I could say I am a born First-Class, but too many of us cannot be like that.WE NEED REDEMPTION.I have to say it is the Top-10 Movie I have ever watched. And it even can be the best TWO out of all, the other one is Leon."
419,True,"So the shawshank redemption is a 1994 prison movie staring Tim Robbins as former banker turned double murderer Andy Dufrense. When Andy's wife and her lover are found murdered at a country club Andy is blamed and sentenced to two back to back life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State penitentiary ran by a sadistic head guard named Byrom Hadley as well as the corrupt warden Samuel Norton. When Andy decides he wants a rock hammer to carry on his hobby of shaping rocks he meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Reading described as ""a man who knows how to get things"" Red is also ""the only guilty man in Shawshank"" as all other inmates claim they are innocent. Andy and Red quickly become friends as Andy repeatedly tries to convince all the other inmates that remembering there are places outside of Shawshank and they should not accept they may never leave the prison. Andy then takes a young high school dropout named Tommy under his wing to help him get his high school qualifications it is this boy that brings forth the revelation of Andy's innocents after telling the story of about a old cell mate who claims to have committed an identical crime which he got away with. After Andy's young friend is shot dead by Hadley Andy asks an inmate to get him a 6ft long piece of rope. the next morning Andy does not show for roll call and Red fears he has committed suicide however the do not find Andy hanging in his cell like Red expected they do not find him at all the night before a plan that took 19 years to get ready took place and Andy had escaped Shawshank prison. This is by far one of the greatest movies of all time Frank Darabont showcases his skill for the first of many times collaborating with Stephen King this movie should definitely be brought on blu-ray right now if you haven't seen it what are you waiting for."
420,True,"I admit it, not being a fan of prison movies and being puzzled by the strange title, at first glance this film wasn't very appealing to me, but it ranks #1 on IMDb and that made me curious. I also admit that at first I was disappointed, the beginning seemed like another Hollywood cliché: man falsely convicted for murder, and it all looked like yet another fight-for-your-proper-rights movie. But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast. I guess it will always remain debatable which movie is ""the best"", I think one should not taint the extraordinary contribution of this movie to film history with such petty discussions. Without the slightest doubt this is one of - if not the - best movie(s) I've ever seen."
421,True,"Why do so many people love this film? We see a story that offers us all hope. There is hope, real hope, all of us can have. As a Christian, I see many reflections of the Gospel in this film. It is interesting to me, how so many love the film, yet reject Christianity and the message it brings. Again, it's simply interesting. It may say more about the Church than about those who love the movie. A question I always ask myself, who has the greater redemption in the film, Andy or Red? On the surface, many can see it as Andy. After all, he is wrongly convicted. He goes to prison. He escapes. He has his ultimate redemption. One can easily view the film in this light. However, I believe Red has the greater redemption. Here is why. Andy is goes to prison without committing the crime. Andy has a physical redemption. Yet, it is Andy who always has hope, always has a plan, and always brings light. To his inmates, to the world he inhabits. Red is guilty. His crime, his sin, has pervaded into his life. He has lost hope of what might be. His life is prison. He cannot escape, even as he gets out into the ""real world."" He is still not redeemed, spiritually in his soul. Andy's journey through the dark tunnel is a foreshadowing of the darker journey Red is walking. And we don't know if Red will survive. Yet Red has a redeemer. It is Andy. Andy never gives up on Red, even after he has escaped. He does everything he can to keep connecting, communicating, and reaching Red, to say to him - this is not the end, there is hope. You only have to take a step. You have to get busy living. Red does. He finds hope. He is truly redeemed. As a Christian, I see great connections between this film and the Gospel. I see in this story large elements of the Greatest Story. We have a Redeemer. He was without sin, He was not guilty, yet He came to us, in a world filled with sin, darkness, and death. He came to our Shawshank. He came to set the captives free. In this world, He healed, He taught, He educated, He cared for, He encouraged, He worked miracles. In this world, He continued to be wrongly accused, persecuted, beaten, mocked, and sentenced to death itself. He entered into the dark hole. He traversed through the darkest tunnel we can imagine. He rose again. Yet this was not the end. It was the beginning. The beginning of His work to continue reaching out to us, communicating to us, doing everything He could to say there is hope. He wrote us a letter in His Word, the Bible. He gave us the means to take the journey, a bus in essence, by His Church. He promised He would be there. And He is. He is waiting for us. He give hope and a home. Now and forever. Red's redemption can be a portrait of our greater redemption. We can say, like Red, ""I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain."" We can be free, truly. We can have hope, fully. Now in the world. Forever, in the world to come. ""Get busy living."" Well said, Red."
422,True,"So, I first would like to say that this was a very good movie. While watching it I realized I was watching the highest rated movie in IMDb. It definitely deserved that rank. I was hooked right from the beginning. I will put an disclaimer for anybody who wants to see it that it being a rated R movie there is vulgar language, violence and showing of alcoholic beverages. Also there is a scene where there might be nudity but from what I can remember I think the most you'll see is some guys butts. The main plot of this movie is about a banker, Andy, who goes to prison because he is accused of killing his wife. He meets a guy named Red and they become best friends. This movie had the right amount of everything without having too much of something. It had comedy, drama, action. When watching this movie it made me think. One of the things I thought about is that life can change on the outside world when you're locked up for so long in an enclosed space. You also can feel so out of place that you'd rather go back to your enclosed space because that's all that you know and feel comfortable with. The movie explains that if you have hope then the outside world isn't too bad. This is a movie that I would recommend any adult to see. Even if you think you might not like this movie or it's not your cup of tea I believe you'll still enjoy it by the time you finish watching the film."
423,True,"Andy Dufrene a banker who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover which he constantly denies .He is sent for life sentence to shaw-shank state penitentiary where he befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding and spends his time doing unconventional thing to keep himself sane.The movie is narrated through the voice of red played brilliantly Morgan freeman who is the prison contraband supplier .Throughout out the movie we see red narrating many prisoners of shaw-shank but mostly focuses on Andy.The Entire movie focuses on various major activities of Andy through out his time in prison. the story also focuses on the subject of the mind state of a long time prisoners their inability to know whats their purpose outside prison ,unless they don't have proper support their only chances are either going back to prison or death.This is a true master-piece from frank Darabont (direction and screen play) and Stephen king .This movie is a 142 minute master- piece .please don't miss this movie"
424,True,"This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
425,True,"There are thousands of written reviews for this film on this website and the majority of them positive. I know I am just adding to this long list of positive reviews, but I feel this film deserves to be my first review on this website. While this film may not be my favourite film, it is most definitely a film I respect. When I was young and watching 'The Goonies' and 'Back to the Future' I thought films were only made to entertain and were not made to convey a clear message about humanity. This film was the first film I watched that made me understand that the film medium could provide the world with such philosophical messages and could teach young people, like me, that life must be valued. Pretty deep right? Well this is the message that the film carries. Red values Andy's friendship and life. He does not want him to die and wants him to survive and when I was watching this film I thought... wow! Two prisoners, one who definitely killed another person, can be so rational and kind. I learnt from this film that the world is a horrible place and emotions can get the better of people; but through it all, it is about moving on and making sure that one is not affected by the emotional trauma that has arrived at their front door and instead take that trauma and improve themselves and other people like Andy did throughout the film. By the end, when Red and Andy are embracing on the beach, free, I see two men who have been through years of pain and self-pity clear of all negative thoughts; I see two friends that through all the emotional trauma that we see them going through are still strong.Now I can talk about themes and the impact that this film had on me all day long, but I have to praise everyone involved in this film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman embody their characters perfectly and when I watch it now as a 17 year old who has seen his fair share of great performances these stick out as real people and not simply a performance. Frank Darababont, who not only directed the film but also wrote it, crafts a film that is very entertaining to watch but that also conveys these themes effortlessly and writes some very memorable lines that really affect one's perspective on human nature. The scene with Brooks is a scene that had me close to tears and that showed me the impact of being 'institutionalized'.Anyway, I have said enough about this film. It is very good and really pushed me into seeing films in a different light. If you want to read any more reviews or my list on my favourite films of all time please check me out. Thank you for reading this."
426,True,"Parents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.-Common Sense Media"
427,True,"Firstly I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly woven, superbly performed, and flawlessly shot cinematic masterpiece that is sure to never be forgotten. Along with Darabont's other prison outing, The Green Mile, he has crafted a pair of subtly affecting dramas with real heart. Shawshank, however takes the prize. Phenomenal stuff. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?"
428,True,"Best movie I've ever seen. I keep this movie on auto-play. Great casting. Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dufresne, an innocent man in prison, who has to break the law while in prison, to live a free life as a fugitive on the run, outside of prison. James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin, gave a wonderful performance as a man who spent his whole life as a caged bird, once given his wings, he has forgotten how to fly free. Instead of living in a cage again, he opted for a pine box. A solitary man, in a solitary cage, for all eternity. Knowing that the character of Ellis ""Red"" Redding, in the book, is supposed to be a middle-aged Irish man, Frank Darabont's casting of Morgan Freeman solidified this character and brought to life the authoritative demeanor that only Morgan Freeman could pull off. There were many other actors who were considered for the role of ""Red"" but Morgan Freeman pulled off a commanding performance.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, was a great casting coup. Seeing him play an innocent man who is forced to conspire with the prison warden, in order to be free of the resident prison bullies, commit money laundering, in order to plan the perfect jailbreak and live life outside of prison as a free man, with a new identity that is ""the 3rd cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.""Clancy Brown as Capt. Byron Hadley, the sadistic jail warden, who gets off on beating prisoners who don't do what he says. Great character actor. William Sadler & Bob Gunton are another great character actors. Bob delivers a great role as a ""holier than thou,"" bible-thumping Christian with greed & corruption on the brain. In the end, Karma serves her justice in the form of a .38 to the head. the movie is full of suspense and has you rooting for the ""innocent"" guy at the end. Worth watching over and over again."
429,True,"An emotional ride with truly believable characters which have more heart than most modern movies. well worth its position at top of the table... a masterpiece, a movie which all movies fail to reach, it doesn't need superhero's or special effects, it just has a solid story which could happen to anyone, a fluidity which speeds by and left you wanting more at the end... what happens?... we all want to see how the lives of each of the main characters turn out at the end.. we know (Spoilers) they meet up after prison.. but how do they spend the rest of their lives?... together forever?.. or just a passing visit.. a movie this length which wants you to see even more.. is groundbreaking .. anyone who has not seen this movie.. shame on you all.. if your on netflix tonight and dunno what to watch this is the movie for you and trust me you shall not be disappointed.. Morgan freeman's voice alone should merit a watch.. Tim Robbins.. a role of his career"
430,True,"Most often when we see a prison film, we think of Oz with a bunch of ruthless convicts, shower rape, and cartons of cigarettes. Shawshank gives a much different perspective. While it has subtle notes of the norm, there is much more emphasis on how one does and passes time, hard time, in a penile system wrought with conflicts. We have a true innocent--a well-read and good-hearted man, Andy Dufresne, caught up in a prepubescent justice system, void of forensic evidence and ballistic reports, teeming with graft and greed on the behalf of the ""God- fearing"" warden. In this world, the guards are more murderous than the inmates, friends stick together more than families, and becoming conditioned to the system gives parolees nightmares about their impending freedom. This story is akin to The Count of Monte Cristo and Alexandre Dumas even gets a brief shout-out in a library scene. For more reason than I can state in this brief review this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and one of a seldom group to which I have given a perfect rating. It is worth the two hours of screening time and you will find yourself rooting for Andy and Red to the very end."
431,True,"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."
432,True,Great planning from the beginning to end I appreciate his planning A hope is always keeps a man alive rather it would complete or not but hope always has a helping hand to human to be positive and keep struggle for their destination and be strategic for his planning this movie also shown the long term planning which is positive and legit when i hear about this movie i thought it would be boring movie and when i sit to see it it is actually boring in starting you have to wait for new climax in the movie after half of the movie i got interest to watch what would Andy do if he fails to flee from prison but it keeps interest with Andy's long strategy for years and eventually he accomplished with his mind blowing planning to get new identity and full bank balance of jailer well it's a great movie to watch
433,True,"The film I watched it several times, every time is not the same feeling, perhaps this is the charm of the film. This film is not simply to evaluate how, only to see their own to realize what is really classic. It is difficult to have relevance and meaning of these two words interpretation of dreams and save a movie can be better than ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the movie to bring psychological shock and washing has never been so deep, two lines and two black male protagonist Andy Reed together created a dream about freedom and soul save the best story, when the movie, can not help feeling compared to Andy's experience, we seem to be in a life but the ridge could be what, this is the temperature of the film, in fact the life has a dream, even if failure, as long as the heart has the dream, we will be able to get the hope of salvation."
434,True,"Shawshank Redemption is hands down one of the best movies that I've ever seen and probably will be one of my favorite movies of all time. I think what really made this movie stand out to me was how vividly all the actors portrayed their roles. The warden, Andy, red, brooks, the officers, the homosexual men. All these personas portrayed by the various actors gave life to the story and to each and every moment within a movie. It truly is a 10 of 10 IMO. Also I think I simply enjoyed how Andy got what he deserved after he escaped from prison. There's a lot to say about the plot and all the actors but I really became enamored by Andy as a character and just seeing him free made me enjoy the movie that much more."
435,True,"I remember watching this movie whilst I was very young. My mum cried, basically as soon as the title popped up until the credits. Sometimes you forget things and then there are times when you remember something very vividly. I recall this movie making me feel very sad but it was a deep sadness not easily fixed with a ""it's just a movie"" comfort. Freedom is one of the very few things we really have and I simply cannot imagine being locked up, no matter for how long, and for something incredibly unfair. When Andy escapes and at last breathes in deep, I breathed with him and I felt looking at freedom as ours. Even though I really enjoyed this movie I have been unable to watch it again for fear of feeling too much again, it was that good."
436,True,"simple approach to art can be a virtue when chaos reigns in the world. Just like the neo-folk music that serves as its soundtrack while providing an emotional salve for its characters, ""Song One"" initially serves as a lilting if sometimes downbeat respite from the cacophony that often passes as cinema today.But even a stripped-down emo-ode to the healing power of music needs to build up to a satisfying crescendo. In her feature debut, writer/director Kate Barker-Froyland tends to tiptoe away from the dramatic high notes that audiences often crave and comes up a stanza or two short from a fulfilling resolution.Often, ""Song One"" feels like the timid B-side of last summer's more satisfying music-biz saga, the much less woe-is-me and a lot more let's-have-some-fun ""Begin Again."" Unlike many low-budget indie titles, however, the novice filmmaker does have the benefit of a couple of actual stars in her cast. They go far to help carry this story about how a young woman reconnects with her family in New York after a car accident leaves her estranged brother (""Boardwalk Empire's"" Ben Rosenfield), a Brooklyn-based busker, in a coma.As Franny, a rather sullen globe-trotting anthropologist working on her doctorate, Anne Hathawaylooking like the early Liza Minnelli with her gamine hairdoisn't quite as distraught as she was while winning her 2012 supporting Oscar as miserable prostitute Fantine in ""Les Miserables"" or as a weepy astronaut in last year's ""Interstellar."" Still, her big-screen crying jag continues apace as she and her mother (Mary Steenburgen, who does what she can as a self-absorbed intellectual whose props include American Spirit cigarettes and a twee accordion) take turns sitting vigil in the hospital while hoping for a miracle. Remember when Hathaway charmed us as a quick-witted gangly Everygirl in ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" that could make us laugh? Where has she gone? Back to the plot. Lacking a sanctuary while back homeher mother has symbolically given her bed away to her mail personFranny stays in Henry's room and, like the anthropologist she is, steeps herself in what he has been up to while pursuing his music dreams. Besides recordings, there is a journal stuffed with scribblings: lyrics, deep thoughts, photosand, lo and behold, a ticket to an upcoming concert by his favorite balladeer, James Forester.If you get an inkling that Franny and hipster-poet James will get involved romantically after she tells him about Henry's situation and his admiration for him, that would be a bingo. Johnny Flynn, the English actor-musician who plays James, duly possesses the soulful eyes and shy presence of a folk artist. And he certainly sings and performs well enough, both on guitar and violin. It is not hard to believe that countless giggly girls in their summer frocks would line up after the show to see him.He is also kind enough to stop by to see Henry the next day. Alas, his character is soon revealed to have all the personality of a very sincere though slightly damp sponge. It also is a little too convenient that he has been dumped by his girlfriend, which has blocked his talent for composing new material. Guess who will be his next muse? Bingo again.What time Franny doesn't spend with James in clubs is devoted to appealing to Henry's senses with familiar sounds and smells in the hopes it will stir him. She records street noises for him to hear. She buys takeout pancakes from his favorite all-night diner and pours syrup on them in front of his nose. Franny even shells out money for an antique gramophone to replace one that Henry broke and spins some scratchy records on it in his hospital room. Will her efforts pay off? Will we be able to tolerate her and James' somewhat ill-advised relationship long enough to find out? One wonders what Hathaway saw in this only partially-baked story. It turns out Barker-Froyland was an assistant to ""Prada"" director David Frankel, and it is nice to know that the actress is supporting her climb up the Hollywood ladder.But for those hoping that Ms. ""Les Miz"" will sing again for her supper, given the subject matter of ""Song One,"" you will have to settle for Hathaway's intentionally amateurish crooning of America's soporific '70s chestnut ""I Need You."" At least she knew better than to revive ""A Horse With No Name."""
437,True,"With little bit of suspense,it's make me insane. It's one of the best movie i have ever seen. I was very enjoying the movie. escape plan of Andy Dufresne is amazing but most amazing thing was the identity of Andy Dufresne simply clever. Morgan Freeman is always enjoyed to watch. Tim Robbins is give dedication to this role is exceptionally well. Tim Robbins feels that role and feel like it's alive. Other guy like Bob Gunton,William Sadler supports very well in this film.Segment in which reveal that how Andy Dufresne was escaped with help of small tool.It's interesting movie to watch with one seat.Never wanted to go away and missed any shot.So i can describe it as clever,Incredible,Excellent."
438,True,"Very good movie. I can't say anything bad about it. It was touching, exiting and grand!I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young, even though I didn't understand everything but I still loved it. I find so many levels of entertaining in this movie, I have seen it many times, and every time I see something new!The prison brake part is very clever, and so exiting! The idea is great and it is one of my favorite movies.I would recommend it to anyone, young or old, man or woman10/10 if I could give it more, I would!"
439,True,"The best movie of all time! Great acting, great story, great emotions and breathtaking moments. When you see the way that Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman acting, you suddenly feel and think that there is no better actors for this roles and this film. The escaping scene of Tim Robbins.. There are not many words to describe this moments. The happiness and the relaxation that he feels is indescribable. But showing us the way he feels this feelings is more than indescribable, it is amazing! The story of each character is fitting the best way that it could. We must all be thankful for watching this movie and thankful for each person that contributed this movie."
440,True,"So the story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who has been falsely sentenced to prison. In prison, he meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), to help him understand many things about life within the four walls. The newcomer seems different than most of the rest though, and, especially in the beginning, attempts to give his co- prisoners moments to live for, moments forgotten for most of them through simple and imaginative ways. As time goes by, he comes to terms with what has happened and (no matter how he tries to help and evolve), he understands what he is supposed to do for the rest of his life. But there is one thing he won't let go: Hope.I will agree with those who have an issue with the fact that this movie is considered to be ""the best of all time"". I think it's really not THAT good. Although I understand it may has a reason and it's on purpose, the pace is slow (could be characterized ""too slow"") and the music (pretty important for this class of a movie) is ""eh.."" And last complaint: Gil Belows as ""Tommy"" was so annoying...Having said that, there is no one who can deny that it's a beautiful story and greatly told. It's pretty simple really. And it's that simplicity of the story that makes it great... The film takes place in a prison and while most of the people who are going to see it have never been in prison (obviously), Frank Darabont makes you connect with every single character in the film. And he does it so elegantly, you won't even understand it happened. It says more about hope and life with lost purpose than any other film I have recently seen. And when I say ""recently"", I mean films that have been out there the last 20 years. The performances in the movie are extraordinary. Morgan Freeman is great and I guess, even if most people don't really like him, Tim Robbins plays a role he fits exactly into. Bob Gunton is the perfect Warden to portray the necessary villain. I didn't really like William Sadler as Haywood but hey... that's the point, ""not to like him"", right? What I really liked most is the way this movie found time to cover all those issues without losing it's focus. It's great how you are not distracted at all when several things take place, while they are not contributing to the full-story. And yet... you care. Because it's something more than just a case or a chase... It's about life. And you can never get bored in this movie if you're watching to learn something. That's why the people who choose this movie to be moved and capture something emotionally greater and more ambitious than huge gunfights and cop-stories, will be fully pleased. People who choose this expecting for the bomb to blow up and some guys yelling ""Get Down!"" and swearing... sorry, this is not for you."

443,True,"This movie is, in my opinion, the best movie of all time. I like it because the acting talent is exceptional, the screenplay is top notch and you really feel for it all. The visual effects are standard, but that is just fine. It doesn't make a difference either way. The plot is such that it makes you wonder whether or not he should be in the prison, as his attitude to everything seems unlike a murdering criminal. Tim Robbins proves his innocence well in the role, as well as his intelligence, spirit and also the fact that he can hide a hole in the wall for nearly 20 years. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, gives excellent narration and acts well, and is the start of the 'Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman' trend. The rest of the acting cast is so believable you could've thought that it was made in the 1950s. What's more, you will be incredibly satisfied with the ending, as it is possibly the best-crafted ending in movie history."
444,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one movie, that every person should watch at least once during their lifetime. It's a classic drama/crime movie, which starts in 1946 with Andy Dufresne, a banker being wrongly accused and convicted of his wife's and wife's loves murder. He is sentenced to life at the Shawshank Prison, He arrives at the Shawshank prison and befriends a fellow prisoner Red who finds Andy's acts rather daring as well as amusing during his time at the shawshank prison. Using just a small Hope and Time as his tools Andy finds out a way to escape from that hellhole, emerging as the most extra-ordinary prisoner of his time.The story revolves around friendship, strength and hope. Andy gains respect among the fellow prisoners and makes the passage for his escape so cleverly which even the warden himself could not figure out till the end, The climax of the story is what makes it a huge hit amongst the masses. Only after watching such a master piece by Stephen King can one actually find out why It tops the list of IMDb top 250."
445,True,"I saw Shawshank Redemption after seeing it in top 10 list of all rating sites. I must admit that it thoroughly deserved its top spot. Its a movie which intrigues you with its characters & events. The characters are build up interestingly.The movie just blows your mind when the suspense is revealed.Till that time i bet no one could ever guess that whats gonna happen next.The acting is superlative the dialogues are amazing.Its laid back style of unfolding of events is refreshing .The story is truly about hope triumphing in the grimmest of circumstances.The Must watch classic which is only comparable to the best of all times like Casablanca, Pulp Fiction, The Apartment."
446,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 epic American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.This is very good film. I like red in this movie he was a very good supporting actor. this is my favourite movie. the best scene is when he plays the music into the Mick. Another reason why this movie is good in all the actors give an amazing performance. Spoilers he escapes. An amazing film. The role for Andy Dufresne was first offered to Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner, but they couldn't play the role because of issues with the dates. Later, Kevin Costner strongly regretted his decision on turning down the character of Andy Dufresne. Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Nicolas Cage were considered for the part of Andy Dufresne, which finally went to Tim Robbins. For the role for Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman and Robert Redford were considered, because in Stephen King's book, Red was an Irishman. It was meant to be played by a white actor in the first place, but director Frank Darabont wanted to cast Morgan Freeman as Red.Frank Darabont wanted his favorite character actor James Whitmore to act in the film, so he asked him to do the role for Brooks. The role for the character Tommy Williams played by Gil Bellows was first going to Brad Pitt. Though this character had a small part, it was an important role in the film.[8]I have seen is movie 17 times. The movie cant be better. If you have not watched this movie then what are you waiting for.I end with a quote ""he dispersed like a fart in the wind."""
447,True,"I never wrote a review before, but I couldn't resist myself after watching this movie.The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. Morgan Freeman did a really good job on acting.... i love it. After all this years,I have been watched so many movies,but no one can compare with this greatest movie in the world in my mind! If you haven't seen this movie well you should watch it right now. It's worth it ! This movie is excellent in every way you look at it.This is a movie to be watched over and over. Each time I get a little bit more out of it. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life."
448,True,"Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James . also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized""."
449,True,"Tonight I celebrate my love for you It seems the natural thing to do Tonight no one's gonna find us We'll leave the world behind us When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too Tonight, our spirits will be climbing To a sky filled up with diamonds When I make love to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And soon this old world will seem brand new Tonight we will both discover How friends turn into lovers When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to youTonight I celebrate my love for you Tonight"
450,True,"I would rate this as one of the best movies I've ever watched, unfortunately, at home. Great story, great characters, lots of feelings and emotions.I remember to feel anxious about the escape, to feel the pain and happiness transmitted by each moment in the movie.Decades waiting for a release that would never come, and after so much time having the guts to try a jail break and find some comfort outside, in a world which wasn't exactly the same left behind.A must watch, without hesitation, even if only one time in your life. A lesson to everyone's life, don't give up, even when there is not too much hope in the horizon."
451,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is truly one of the best movies ever made. With picture perfect performances all around. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies you can watch and re-watch and re-watch and love it each time. The sad part is it didn't get the fame and Oscars it deserved.7 Oscar Nominations and no wins does not do justice to the quality of this movie.The Shawshank Redemption is a must buy and keep to watch again and again. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters as Andy Dufresne and Red respectively, take them to a whole new level, which in-turn suck the viewer into their world of highs and lows.If this movie isn't a part of your collection already get it now."
452,True,"Let me get this straight, when I first watched this film I loved it. However when I first watched this film, I was thirteen, and agreed with everything I read. I thought the film was too long, with too much fat, and solemn fat at that. I thought Tim Robbins does a good job, and plays the role how he ought to, but the role still doesn't set my world alight. I'm not a Morgan Freeman fan, that's just me personally. I thought this was one of his more believable roles, before he became a parody of himself. The worst thing about this film is the script, and I feel it thrives in moments of silence. I enjoyed the playing of the record, I thought Brooks hanging himself was excellently done, I thought the rape scene was nasty but not too gruelling. These scenes were well judged, because this film could have so easily fallen into torrid and depressing territory, and it does do that a little bit. I felt the iconic moments of wisdom, are really not so clever. To me they sound like quotes written on a page, and scattered throughout.Overall I think it is a very good film. This is me really reviewing with reference how the average person views the film. What I'm trying to say is that this is not close to best film of all time material. It does nothing groundbreaking or exceptional in terms of filming, or storytelling, or performance or anything. If you watch the film as a whole it's pretty good but not fantastic, if you look at it in bits, some bits are fantastic, others are pretty poor. There's no way I can look at this film an even compare it to Citizen Kane, or Psycho, or Birth of a Nation. It is not on that level of film making.Eight out of Ten."
453,True,"Best movie of all time? Maybe a overstatement. Or maybe not? You should watch the movie and decide for yourself. Im pretty sure this movie wont let you down, and you will see what all the hype is about. My friends had to talk me in to see this movie, but I very grateful to them that they did. This is the best movie I've seen in all my life. Good plot. Excellent characters. Very good actors, you really get in touch with the characters. Tim Robbins, surprises me in this movie. Morgan Freeman, huge fan of him.You should really just rent the movie, sit down, and enjoy this 2 hour long movie. You will never regret it.And yes, it is as good as everyone says it is :) Enjoy!"
454,True,"What if the tunnel was blocked at the end and so he ended up trapped there? I guess he could have crawled backwards and up out the pipe again, but still horrible to think about. This film is so popular because the pipe symbolizes your working life and the beach scene at the end is the escape from working life. Its not about prison, its about the 9 to 5.Everyone wants to do an Andy Dufresne.Also, he'd escaped his marriage and gets to live out his life having fun on the beach playing around a boat with his pal and that is presented as the definition of Paradise, maybe it is, but you know it'd probably get old after a couple of days."
455,True,"The manner of story presentation is very impressive , the way main plot is valiantly attempted to be kept away from the attention and keep minor sub-plots going surprises the viewer towards the end . It shows the virtue of patience in success full completion of any task. Apart from that content was precise , no junk songs or scenes to dilute the experience of viewer. Overall quite compact , direct , and point to point method of story telling . Although in terms of marketing , there might have been concerns of the movie not appearing to be appealing enough to the viewing audience but who so ever gave it a go , would have been delighted this excellent masterpiece. So I strongly recommend everyone to go and watch it for sure."
456,True,"I never wrote a review before, but I couldn't resist myself after watching this movie, no doubt one of the best movie I have watched.I Had this movie with me from a long time, but never was interested to watch it. and then couple of times tried to watch it but every time it was less than 30 Min. and then one of my frnd told me about this movie he saw and I was so impressed with the story and screenplay. on the same night I watched it and its amazing.everyone who wants to be thrilled or amazed pls watch this movie. I would not like to discuss the story because that ruins your pleasure of watching this movie. but I can assure you that watching this movie will amaze you."
457,True,"Instead of the other prison and drama movies, this film was really emotional and absorbing. First years of our main character, he experienced harmful things and the movie made us feel that mood. We could barely understand that he would escape from prison but I couldn't make a thought about how he will escape, with digging a hole? Yes, he dug a hole and escaped but It wasn't like the other prison-escape movies. The plot was strong, cast was strong and we lived while we were watching the film, for me of course. I loved the film and this is one of those 'unforgetable' movies. I don't like to watch films that I already watched but I can watch this movie ten times and will not get bored. We need productions like this one. And lastly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.. They didn't act, they lived the movie.."
458,True,"I think a movie is unconscious and is still the best and I everyone i can.Nagyon offer thought-provoking throughout story.Really live problem is that if you spend too much time institution will depend on him and do not find yourself later world. Morgan Freed also extremely well suited to the role , for me, the One of the best actors I've ever even particularly like the I knew.Ami the time in which it takes place throughout this period in particular, like him.This film is a perfect example of how you can be the epitome of a good story to make.If I could I would go back to this era and very happy to be living in it , is quite close to my heart."
459,True,"He Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10"
460,True,"Great movie! With a great sense! Everyone needs to see it at least once in your life! Tim Robbins played great, as well as Morgan Freeman! William Sadler was also on top! I love this movie! Each replica in this film contains a deep meaning! Which makes you wonder about many things! All the same, not all of the film adaptation of Stephen King's books are terrible! There are exceptions! And this movie in this number! Directing excellent! Here we can not speak bad! This profile is one of the best that I saw in my entire life! Of films in the world is very small! If everyone in this film was such as this, the crime would not be in our world!"
461,True,The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece
462,True,"Greetings from Croatia to all...just want to say that this movie is for me,personally,the best movie ever made....keep up the good work...great acting and great theme..and now to complete my review i must write 10 lines of text so i will just speaking about everything :D so what should i write? There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bulls*** word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a sh**.the best quote ever! :D"
463,True,"My life is forever changed due to this movie. It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship. It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. For some of those people time will tell. As for now I'll be patient to wait and see. Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out. There is someone out there that cares for you. Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."
464,True,"One Of the Best Movie Ever Made.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
465,True,"Shawshank Redemption is another great movie. This movie is telling about the Andy Dufresne's life, performed by Tim Robbins. He is a young banker who has a high opportunity in his job, then his life is turning into the dark, he has to move into a jail just because the court judged that he killed his wife and adulterer while he did not do anything. This point shows me about gap in the law and how the justice court becomes unfair, it's like a reflection of the reality and i do like it. However, the story is told by Red, Morgan Freeman, a close friend of Andy while he was in a prison, it broadcasts every single things in prison, such like right, equality, freedom, and corruption. That's why the movie can persuade the audiences to believe that Andy was really wrong. The story is telling very silently, but the unexpected situation is coming up continuously.It does not make me surprise when I heard that Shawshank got many awards, even many people said that Forrest Gump is better than it and got the rewards more. In my opinion, I think it is because Shawshank is hard for understanding sometimes and the audiences did not get it. It's like this movie is telling by the third party and it was just a new style of a movie at that time. Deeply, It is amazing for me because I cannot guess what is the truth, what is not."
466,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, this two men also produced the film named 'the green mile'. This film is about one young and successful man who works in bank named 'Andy Dufresne who is convicted by court that he murdered his wife and her lover. This made him has to get in the jail named Shawshank, which has many friendship, injustice, ferocity, and hope. With the good storytelling make this film isn't that boring although it's a long movie but we all forget the time while watch it. This story show many sides of the society, show the part of prisoners that do not get the acceptance from the society, show the part of many richer who has power but corruption the society. The injustice between people and prisoners make this film is interesting. With the good a casting, story telling, edited, sound technical and many things make is film is perfect. As you know that this film is the best movie on IMDb and I also guarantee that this movie will make you impress."
467,True,"I just said 'representation of world', because actually it is ! The shawshank redemption showed how world is cruel and cannot be forecasted, by using limited area and place with specific characters. It is quite old film but, still can be explained this era. I tried to watch this film as 2 kinds of views. First, I saw the shawshank jail represent as the human society. In limited place, people really want to make their own 'laws and rules' for them. Sometimes, it looks like nonsense nor illogical but, we;I mean human did actually and.. In this society, there is invisible hierarchy also. Secondly, This film showed how people are survive with their own way in society. Some people do not understand the change, and also some other people are against the laws and rules, such as Andy. Especially, Brooks who kill himself showed the people who do not accept the change their environment. I can see myself, which kind of people am I? This film tells us many things, not only these. When time after time, it will be showed different way, so sure."
468,True,"Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: ""Maybe it's because I'm Irish."".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it ""a poster child for Christianity"". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts."
469,True,"This work from 1994 directed and written by a Hungarian-American Frank Darabont that was based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was nominated for several highly appreciated awards, including The Academy Awards and The Golden Globe Awards. In spite of being nominated for so many prestigious prizes, it did not win any. However, this fact cannot put a shadow over the fantastic job that was done while making the movie. Critics from all over the world were absolutely amazed by the drama with outstanding and unbelievably realistic scenery. It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the main protagonists  experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will provide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes a friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis ""Red"" Redding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small stone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he overhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes. Thanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the library so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years pass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works worked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can receive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an irredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red and when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his former inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed two people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's innocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he has young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He tells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village and instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day, Andy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy escaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as Randall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the laundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what has happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and the newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch the bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the best judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion and how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of ones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating skills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply settled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story. I haven't seen such a well-thought-out plot like this in a long time. The diligent work of the producers, cameramen, costume designers, make-up and hair stylists and all of the crew will be remembered. I can't write this without mentioning the set. I have already talked about it, but I need to praise it a little bit more. It was so easy to get into the plot thanks to the set  you do not get a chance to doubt the realism of the scenery. Another aspect to be spotlighted is the soundtrack. Magnificent Thomas Newman and his team produced a piece of quality material which does not stay unnoticed and bonds you even more with the whole drama. Last but not least, I must applaud the directing and screen writing of Mr. Darabont who created a completely unique and new experience for TV viewers and cinema audiences. We can only guess what happens in the end until we finally get to see the finish line of Shawshank. I guarantee you will end up with a wide smile on your face.To sum up, we can only thank the entire crew for the spectacular project with an inspiring story of not giving up. The conclusion of my review is as brief as it can be  go and book your place in front of the big screen! You will not regret it. The massive number of emotions you can experience while watching The Shawshank Redemption will make you laugh or cry whenever you want."
470,True,"""When the world is not that kind of beautiful. Injustice is the only thing that exist."" It's from the wrote of Stephen King and arranged by Frank Darapont, the very good director, although they can't get so much view but people said it's kind of the best film.They tell the story to Andy Dufresne, the banker who was sentenced to be in prison because of killed his wife. So, he was in jail at Shawshank. He had to bear with wickedness everyday.It's kind of normal movie that is just a good man in the prison that everything is very frightful. But this movie can make us concentrated without anything to complain."
471,True,"Simple but complicate. This movie is great movie in element of the story telling. I haven't known the plot before; I thought It was a regular movie but it wasn't. It is one of the best movie that I ever seen. Frank Darabont did a great job and he has directed clearly story. He makes every character in the movie become important in the movie. Firstly, I thought Anny was tried to survive in the prison day by day. Red he was a leader of the prisoner. At first I thought he would have a conflict with Anny because He imported things from outside the prison to sold in prison to make a profit for himself. Anny always asked for different thing from other prisoners with him. But truly he had a coolest plan for getting out of prison. The story was complicated but story was telling smoothie because he had plan to escape from the prison. He made the warden trust him by working for him. The warden used him to did his dirty work even he had destroyed the last evidence that Anny wasn't guilt. Finally, Anny payback by a very cleaver plan. So, If you are the fan of prison brake movie. You must watch."
472,True,"The movie is amazing.First let me begin with the theme of the movie. The theme and the concept of the movie is quit predictable because before watching i know that it is a movie about a main character try to break out the the prison and i am quit sure that at the end the main character will succeed and it is definitely like what i thought. but what make this movie great are what is in the movie. All the detail that are given and toward the running of the story line that make it is unpredictable for me of what going to happen next even though i already know that he will break out of the prison successfully.The setting of the movie is not much special because most of the time it is in the prison so not much to talk about, but it is still great that we as a viewer got the see how a real prison look like a how does it really feel as we follow the main character throughout the whole movie.The lighting of the movie is pretty dark and giving a sad and hopeless feeling to us viewer so it is great that we get to feel what the characters feel too.This movie gave me a point of view of a people who is in a prison for to long and don't have a clue of what they will do if they ever got a chance to come out again or not. This movie contain many emotion feeling of the character and really done well on delivering it to us viewing.The casting of the movie is amazing all the character and the actor really look believable like they are who they are.After watched the movie, it gave me so many thing to think about and how hard and how corrupt the world is today, even though the world we live on now is on the different era but there will always be a bad man, and it will never change. We just need to do what is right and continue doing it."
473,True,"It is reasonable that it is rank in top 5 of best movies . It has a very good story. This is a worked of Frank Darabont, he also the director of green mile. For the message that they said is very clearly and good in every parts. All scenes and characters is very important. It makes emotional to audience. this movie makes people understand more about the life of prisoners. Some scene is gonna makes audience cry. this movie also teaching people such as , patient , Friendship and etc. Moreover, it looks the realistic in prison. I love the end of the story that show the another side of Red that he has very important role in prison ,but he is not important and invaluable in normal life. It shows a part of life. I love it."
474,True,"No words that i can think of even comes close of how amazing this movie really is. its funny, thrilling and bone chilling. what i really love about this movie is that you really feel for the characters as if they were family. when Brooke's committed suicide I was holding on a pillow shouting. It has it moment, and the greatest flaw of this movie in my opinion is pacing. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.Adding to the slow pacing, Andy acting is neutral is bare shows emotion. Which is charming in a way, because Straight face can magically immerse you in a weird way. Neo from the Matrix series for instance. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. I feel like the fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.In one word, a masterpiece Have come at the wrong time. Nevertheless, still an unforgettable movie. The story will take in. Great movie with fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins..This kind of movie will get you off the hook at first, But it's an acquired taste that you will receive half way through."
475,True,"I watch this movie because this is in one of my assignments from university and professor who is teaching about movie told me to watch, and this is movie is always in top of movie raking. Almost all people who watched The Shawshank Redemption said this movie is good, and considered as the best movie all the time, so I watched it.The story is about a man who named Andy Dufresne, a banker is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in the state of Maine. He befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Spend over 20 years of his life in Shawshank prison and finally he was able to escape from Shawshank prison.I think this movie is interesting enough that always on top in movie ranking. I like this kind of drama movie and it is tear jerking story. Personally I do not like the movie has too much violence, shouting, or yelling. In the beginning I was bored and do not want to continue to watch because there was a scene that Hadley and other prison guards punch and kick until a new prisoner die. Also there are so many scenes that similar to this scene. Those things are what I do not like. Over all, I like this movie."
476,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie involving story about life in prison that represents through crimes, bribery, sexual harassment, and drama. This movie was simple but it delivers meaningful messages in all characters' performance especially in the scene when their eyes contact. This film contains emotional impact about true friendship and hope. Brief the plot: Andy, a successful banker, was accused of murdering his wife and her affair. He was sentenced to Shawshank Prison for that. Later in prison, Andy helped one of the prison guards to evade taxes. In return, the prison guard gave Andy and Red, his best friend in Prison, some cold beer. From this cause, Andy became a popular guy in the prison and made a lot of friends. After several years of slowly piercing through the wall using some kind of art equipment, Andy finally broke out of prison. A couple of years later, Red was released out of Shawshank Prison. He came to meet Andy at the beach that Andy told him to meet up when he get released. The highlight of this movie is when Andy used his specialty in evading taxes to make the wardens trust him. The biggest surprise for me is when Andy asked the warden for rope, most of the people who watch will predict that he will commit suicide but the truth is, he used to it tight things up and escape from the prison. In conclusion, the acting in this movie is very good, the storytelling is amazing, exciting and brilliant, and production is quite simply. This movie is very amazing because it teaches me that people must always have hope to move on in their life."
477,True,"The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times."
478,True,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialog of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialog does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialog. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much- needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
479,True,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance."
480,True,"This movie deserves 10/10. And yeah you can can say that there are so many things that help you cut down its rating as left most cell for Andy(A hotshot banker on whom this movie is pictured) or Bogs only dicks with Andy, so what it is still a MOVIE based on novel of Stephan king. Its just that its an ""EPIC MOVIE"". The narration by Morgan freeman is remarkable, it feels like someone is whispering in your ears, when this movie reaches it mid you starts to adore the relation between Andy and red. and that night Andy finally redeem himself from prison, that Rita Haywood poster, that chess board and everything, you starts to love when detailed by red. this movie also has a cliché in which Andy makes himself rich which you want to see and how he keeps his mind occupied and what they think about him. ""Some birds are not meant to be caged, Their feathers are just too bright""."
481,True,"I am 22; And I was craving a well plotted movie the other day. And quite frankly I was quite bored of fantasy movies. I wanted to watch something that had to do with the system. I decided to go through the list of top movies of all times, according to IMDb. The Shawshank Redemption was ranked number one based on popularity. I watched the trailer and I immediately fell in love with the fact that it was narrated by Morgan Freeman and that it was about the prison system in the previous century. The movie The Shawshank Redemption Is about a character named Andy Dufresne, an introverted,young,successful banker. In 1947, one fine morning, Andy finds himself guilty of a crime that he repeated says he didn't commit. However, the evidence says otherwise. They charge him for murdering his wife and her lover. Double life sentence. He soon finds himself in one of the harshest prison in the country. There he meets Red and his friends. Andy takes his time but slowly, tactically, befriends them. Andy's wide range of skills helps him get on good terms with the prison guards, and even the Prison Warden. The Warden soon finds Andy so useful that he starts making Andy help him with his bank statements, allowing him to launder money without any suspicion.Soon Tommy Williams enters the picture, and what he discloses changes everything. The movie was very well directed. However, I wish the story focused a little more on how Andy manages to create a false identity. Overall, the movie was very interesting. I loved how they portrayed all the inmates and their problems. I very much appreciated the fact that they didn't show the prison rapes in details, and left most of it to the imagination. Andy's unreadable characteristics were very well played by the actor Tim Robbins. Throughout the whole time, I simply couldn't figure out whether he was really innocent or not, until Tommy Williams enters the picture. Andy's and Red's friendship develops very realistically. The little jokes they share were very amusing, especially the first time they talk, when Andy asks Red why his name is Red. The villainous Warden's character was very unpredictable. His ""Strict Christian"" image was brilliant. It made it seem that he might have a little bit of goodness inside, but as the story unveils, he turns out to be pure evil. The movie overall was intriguing. It does show some real issues that inmates go through- discrimination, sexual frustration, institutionalization and all forms of abuse. I think the movie is very eye opening. I think the message it wants to send out is that one should get to know the system and how it works so that when the system turns abusive, one can do something about it."
482,True,"This film really impressed. We can feel the friendship between Red and Andy. They start from stranger to become a best friend. Even they are not contact for many years but friendship doesn't gone. I really surprise in the middle of movie that Andy is innocent, because from the beginning at movie, the first day in prison. He look not fear in the prison. In addition, he really intelligence and no one know his plan for escape the prison. In this movie we see difference between Brooks and Red, they are out from prison when they get older but they choose in different way. It like Andy told Red ""get busy watching or get busy dying""."
483,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a Prison tricky film. The prison itself becomes a metaphor for the society, or even to retard people from being completely free instead.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker convicted of killing his wife and her lover is wrongly sent to Shawshank Prison. The first and best friend that he makes is Red, the elder statesman of the yard, played by Morgan Freeman, the one that obviously a great actor who never ever did wrong in his career.At Shawshank, they communicating us about how to survive in here, and what you need to maintain a stage of humanity, which literally reflect us about reality of life. The warden, sexually abused by inmates and even beaten by guards harasses Andy. Sooner or later, Andy gets used to his new living arrangement which someone called home, but still has hope that he will leave Shawshank. As well as he try to reminds others to be hopeful.Shawshank Redemption is not to reform you, but totally drive you crazy. It's not just a film for entertainment; it's educating us about what life really is. Even though the film offers us a prison and corruption, it's definitely warmth my heart and so do you."

The emotion caused by the victim against the perpetrators feel good, dependent on the heart, and even help the offender.

485,True,"I am aware that by now almost everyone knows the plot of this film, but since this is my first reviewed title on IMDb, I'll do my part in explaining it.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on the Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Set in New England, the film tells the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he befriends Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), nicknamed ""Red"" by his friends, and his gang. But he also catches the eyes of ""The Sisters"", a gang of rapists and bullies led by Bogs (Mark Rolston). He then must make up his escape plan, while aiding the guards and most importantly the warden (Bob Gunton) to cheat on their taxes.I was deeply impressed by this film since the first time I watched it, and has remained my favorite film ever since. All of the main actors play their parts beautifully (Freeman in particular), and the ending is the most powerful I have ever seen.A must-see for everyone."
486,True,".....and Ironically, it most certainly does.Bank Merchant Andy Defrene is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment at the titular prison. Life seems to begin to fade, but fortunately Andy befriends some of the other inmates, in particular a character known only as Red. Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can expect in a prison, his body may be locked away in a cell, but his spirit can never be truly imprisoned.....There is nothing to say about this film that hasn't been said before. Its awe-inspiring, its warm, and most of all, it gives you an enormous sense of well being once the credits roll.From the opening shot of the prison, to the iconic Christ like pose in the rain, the film is chock full of religious allegory, and references the bible in several key scenes. But the film demands repeat viewings, because there is so much subliminal imagery and messages in the film.The acting is brilliant, and the warmth between Andy and Red is the heart of the film, and the chemistry between Freeman and Robbins is second to none.Its a perfectly crafted film, with effortless narrative, and it will make you smile and cry in equal measures.Yes, it should have ended when Freeman got on the bus, but nothing is too perfect is it?"
487,True,"The Shawshank redemption is an excellent movie that was executed perfectly. Based off of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie did an exceptional job of recreating the story. The Shawshank Redemption is a top class movie that needs to be seen by anyone and everyone with the perfect features to make it stand out in the crowd of movies.The acting in the movie The Shawshank Redemption is one of the main reasons that the movie turned out to be so wonderful. Combining the skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman proved to be a pair for the ages. With two characters, one quiet, reserved character and one popular, outspoken character, both played by actors with similar personalities. Appreciation was shown for the acting in this movie when Morgan Freeman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Academy Awards 1995). Although he lost, it is still impressive considering he lost to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump/ These two actors were not the only actors vital to the production of this movie. Each individual side character was played by an actor perfect for the part. No actor could have done justice to any of the characters like the actors who starred in the film did.The story of the movie was possibly one of the best told stories of all time. Although it is a recent story when compared with stories from all time, it does the perfect job of immersing you in the lives and feelings of the characters and of keeping you hooked on what happens next the whole time. Stephen King started off by writing this masterpiece of a story in his novella and Frank Darabont worked with this masterpiece and wrote and directed one of the top one hundred movies of all time (AFI Top 100). The story is told over a just longer than two hour movie, that does not go on too long or too short. After the viewer has finished watching the movie, they are perfectly satisfied.The Shawshank Redemption has a Motion Picture Association of America rating of R, or restricted. This rating should be lowered too PG-13, known as Parents Strongly Cautioned. Although the movie does have slight hints at sexual activity and scenes with murders and suicide, this does not outweigh the benefit of people seeing this movie. No person of the age above thirteen, or maybe even lower, should be denied the right to view this movie. The Shawshank Redemption has the potential to have an enormous effect on the lives of those who view it. And even if it does not impact their lives, it still could easily change their perception of a good movie or just be an enjoyable two hours of their lives. Without such heavy restrictions on the age of those who can view the movie, maybe it could have a chance to be more widely viewed, and ultimately more widely appreciated.The AFI Rating of The Shawshank Redemption shows it ranked as the number seventy two American movie of the past one hundred years (AFI Top 100). I strongly disagree with this rating. The Shawshank Redemption, although it didn't cause any revelations in the movie world (mostly because it was too recent to have done so), is one of the best filmed movies of all time. I personally would rate The Shawshank Redemption in the top ten of all movies, and number one on my own personal list. The less official Internet Movie Database ranking of movies has The Shawshank Redemption as the number one movie of all time (IMDB Top 250). This is a much more agreeable rating for my own opinion on the movie. Having seen five of the top ten movies on AFI's renowned list, I do not believe any of them compare to the quality and entertainment value of The Shawshank Redemption. Although I earlier agreed with AFI's rating of The Shawshank Redemption in the top one hundred, I believe it should be much higher than the ranking they decided on.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will go down in history as one of the best movies ever created. This future historical relevance is not an exaggeration. If anything, The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated movie. It's not too often that there comes a movie that is as well made as The Shawshank Redemption, so when one is, it is important to fully appreciate it. The Shawshank Redemption is a grade A movie made up of the perfect components of story and acting which come together to make one of the best movies of all time."

489,True,"When I saw this movie for the first time it made a deep impression on me.The storyline is interesting and the characters are strong.There are some good one liners in the movie what make you remember.It's funny but actually you learn from this movie. Facts that can be useful in real life.The movie what makes it so good in score from everybody is that almost everybody recognize in characters and some scenes.The only disappointing in the movie is the end. You want looking more of the movie, how the story goes further. But this only proves that is very interesting story.I recommend everybody to see this movie."
490,True,"This is not a movie to be watched just for the heck of it. You can't just stumble upon it as you can when looking for an action or comedy movie. Not to say that it can't happen, but if you're going to watch this movie, you have to focus on it and watch it all the way through within a week. I don't know if it is a good representation of modern prisons or prisons from the time it takes place, but regardless of that, you feel for the two protagonists. I found the predicament of Andy to be completely horrific and unfair (though I wish I could find a better word to use here than ""unfair""). Some people might find the message of hope to be kind of corny, which is a view that I can understand but don't share and I'm a guy that finds many things to be corny. The life of the prisoners is brutal, partly because of the guards, but partly because of the conduct of the prisoners. Andy is easy to sympathize with, but also easy to root for because of his perseverance and hope. I like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, too. There is an air of dignity that sets him and Andy apart from the other prisoners. The one rather implausible character point that I found was Andy's selflessness. His ability to sympathize with his fellow inmates and his willingness to better their lives does not necessarily do anything to his desire for the same benefits that they reap. His motive is certainly to help his fellow inmates, but I don't feel like he would as a human just let his hard earned rewards be wasted. The one other main character is the warden, who can either be viewed as a good heartless villain or a guy that the screenwriters forced a mean personality onto with no good reason. I'm not saying that either one is true, it just depends on where you're coming from. I read another review that criticizes the way the warden's quoting of the bible is sort of demonized and was a biased act by the producers. Personally, I disagree with that, because there are plenty of people in real life who use biblical passages and religious motives as an excuse to do bad things. One thing about his character that I didn't really understand was why he is so reluctant to let Andy go free. The story is rather like that of Mr. Holland's Opus in the sense that it is divided up by the minor characters that come and go throughout. You can see how Andy and Red make a difference in the lives of the other inmates and each other. The mystery of how Andy escapes at the end is pretty good, but not something that requires you to have remembered a lot of things from earlier to understand. For anyone considering watching it, I would recommend that you watch it alone or with someone who won't talk through it. Also, don't watch it if you're looking for anything outside of a good or emotional story. Overall Rating: 8.9/10"
491,True,"I have forgotten how many times I have seen this outstanding, heart wrenching film.From start to finish, it has you captured into what life was like for an innocent man in the harshest prisons in America. The main character is of all things, a banker. He is framed for the murder of his wife playing away with another lover behind his back. Next thing you know the husband lands in prison and fighting to stay alive from all the inmates and prison officers. Luckily his accountancy profession saves him and rewards him at the same time. He makes friends with RED and ends up building up the library to a delux place of relaxation, reading and music playing for all the prisoners.The ending just blew my mind.You must see this film, but be warned.....it is absolutely addictive viewing."
492,True,"Sometimes, a classic can come from an unexpected source. That's the case with the Shawshank Redemption. When you only hear about the plot, you'd guess that it may be very enjoyable, but it's been done before. The film is about a prison break. That doesn't sound like an original idea. Shawshank Redemption is based on a Steven King novella named 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. Usually, the film adaptations of Stephen King's novels aren't very strong. The picture was directed by Frank Darabont, who didn't have much of a success record back in 1994. The two leading actors are Tim Robbins, who portrays Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman, who portrays Ellis Boyd Redding (simply known as 'Red'). While they are both very good actors, you wouldn't expect them to have a perfect chemistry. The film also didn't very well in the box office upon its release. So despite all of that, this film has often been referred to as one of the best films of all time. I think that's a fair point to make. You don't expect an all-time classic going into the Shawshank Redemption, but that's exactly what you're going to get. This films sucks you in and blows you away.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947 because he murdered his wife and her lover, or so we believe. He's very introvert at first and doesn't interact with any of the prisoners. That is, however, until he asks Red if he could get Rita Hayworth to Shawshank. Red simply replies that it will take a little while, but he'll manage, since he's a man who knows how to get things. It eventually turns out to be a poster of Hayworth. When Red asks Andy why committed the crime he's been sentenced for, Andy states he's innocent. Of course every other prisoner in Shawshank state that they are innocent, except for Red, who tells Andy he's the only guilty man in the prison. Red and Andy develop a friendship over the years and the chemistry between the two is simply amazing. Andy befriends most of Red's friends, like Heywood (played by William Sadler) and the old man named Brooks Hatlen (played by James Whitmore). Andy's first couple of years in Shawshank are extremely difficult. The 'sisters' have an eye on him and especially their leader, Bogs (played by Mark Rolston). They attempt to rape Andy on several occasions. The prison is run by the corrupted warden named Samuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and his chief of the guards, Byron Hadley, who brutally assaults prisoners to demonstrate his power. In May of 1949, Red and his friends are selected to tar the roof of Shawshank, which keeps them outdoors for a couple of days. Andy confronts Byron Hadley about his financial issues. This eventually leads to an improved prison live for Andy and his friends. Andy helps the prison guards with their financial situation and eventually even does all of the wardens finances. In 1954, Brooks Hatlen is released from Shawshank after having stayed there for 50 years. He can't live a normal live outside of the prison walls and decides to hang himself. Red clarifies that Brook has become institutionalized. After Bogs and the 'sisters' nearly beat Andy to death, Byron Hadley assaults Bogs so so hard he is never able to walk again. Andy continues to control the wardens finances and explains to Red how all the 'dirty' money is washed clean. He made up a person on paper, named Randall Stevens, so all the trails lead to him, but because he's fictional, the I.R.S won't be able to catch anybody. In 1965, Tommy (played by Gil Bellows) arrives in Shawshank for a two year sentence. He's a young guy who loves Rock and Roll. He wants to be educated and Andy starts to teach him. At one point, Tommy hears Andy's story and reveals that Andy is innocent. Andy confronts the warden with this statement, but he's afraid Andy will reveal to the outside world what happens within the walls of Shawshank, so he puts Andy in isolation for two months. During his stretch in isolation, Tommy gets killed by Byron Hadley, because he knew too much, although the warden says he tried to escape. Andy meets Red after getting out of the isolation cell and tells him about his future plans, although Red waves it off by stating Andy's being unrealistic. Andy tells Red to never give up hope. Andy decides he's been in prison long enough and escapes through a tunnel he dug during his time in prison. The following day, Andy travels to Zihuatanejo, a place in Mexico. He leaves with half of Norton's money. The next morning, Byron Hadley is arrested for being a corrupt guard and the warden shoots a bullet through his own skull. After serving 40 years, Red is released from Shawshank. He goes through the same motions as Brooks did and you get the feeling he'll also hang himself, until he remembers he made a promise to Andy, so he searches for an old oak tree near Buxton and finds some money Andy's left for him. He decides to make the trip to Mexico and rejoices with his old friend Andy, while stating he finally dares to hope.This is, simply put, the best film ever created. It's incredibly powerful. The film really sucked me in. The chemistry between Andy and Red is undeniable and the performances from Robbins and Freeman are superb. The supportive cast also does a fantastic job. Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley really looks like a despicable bully and Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton plays his role as the corrupt warden perfectly. This film never drags and the remains entertaining for all of its 142 minutes. Films, in my opinion, don't get any better than the Shawshank Redemption."
493,True,"An excellent thriller movie to watch! So many years passed but it is still a superb movie. Freeman has played an excellent role in the movie.I wish if this movie had some kind of sequel. The movie is that much great that if we watch if 100 times we'll still enjoy it. I really liked the movie because of it's thriller. I liked the movie "" Shutter Island"" because it is as thrilling as this one. The part where Andy gets to know about the killer is the most awesome part of the movie. The best part after that was the escape through a dirty place, everything in the movie was fantastic. I do not have the words to praise this movie. Even 1000 lines are not enough for it."
494,True,"An amazing movie. One of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best. A true classic. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you go watch it as soon as possible!After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart and banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison, which is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with some of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan Freeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy. After many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy does something that will be remembered throughout the history of Shawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story and characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every moment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of the movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably the greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it impossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting characters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the horrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his most memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and Morgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved his Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just incredible."
495,True,"When I started watching the movie, I thought: This is going to be another one of those movies drama in prison, where the guy suffers and escapes and lives happily forever. Just waiting there. Not so. The film reaches the spiritual side of things. Shows how this affects people psychologically. Having cut his freedom is yes, one of the worst things in the world, even when there is no fault. But when you get used to the place, the rules, what is inside you, it becomes your place, your truth. And then you go out. Now what? How do I live? I do not know no more walking on the street! This can really drive someone insane. Another important point is the issue of corruption in jail. Not that common place fell to be the focus of this thing. Was already structured, it was not something that needed to be nor explained. Corruption in the chain is already so common to us, which is not something that needs 20 minutes of film to explain how it works - despite the great scene in the library where Andy pro account as Red in Shawshank laundering scheme works."
496,True,"It is very rare that you will ever come across a movie of this calibre in your entire life. Masterpiece is the only way to describe it.From the moment it starts, you're hooked. You learn of Andy and being sent to prison. The acting is phenomenal, and of course, the viewer is treated with narration from Morgan Freeman throughout the movie.After that, you get to know each character well, all excellently written and diverse. The script is highly intelligent, and the dialogue flows in a smooth and believable way.You find yourself gripped for EVERY second as Andy's perfect plan unfolds, into a tremendous climax, leaving you emotional as you have seen his struggle.If anyone considers themselves a movie fan, then they not only should have seen this film; they should own it.One of the best!!"
497,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. Morgan Freeman did a really good job on acting.... i love it. I was really learning some things in this movie. I like Morgan Freeman films because he is really a good actor. I recommend you this film to watch at least once, because this is a legendary film.I love it when in the end he founds the box with this letter. And then he travels to this place where his friend Andy was repairing the boat. I really enjoyed watching this legendary film. And also this film was made by a true story so it really makes it very very very very very very very good. I hope they will make good films in the future too inspired by a true stories."
498,True,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable."

501,True,"This has to be for me one of the best feel good and most inspiration movies ever. I have to agree that this is a movie that one should own not borrow or rent. If I ever had to say to someone watch this movie this would easily be the one.There are so many reasons for loving this amazingly good movie, but one for me is the life lessons that we learn from this one. I'm not one of those people that likes to give things away. So I wont be using any examples.The cast is great and story is probably one of the best when it comes to movies."
502,True,"Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Anyone who read the Stephen King novel knows red turns from a white guy to a black one. and the guard casually ripping the poster at the end is different but other than those small changes, everything else is on point. This is the best prison movie ever made in my opinion. Certain ironies play out very well in this film. For instance the head sister who get cripple when Andy has had enough of his ilk. A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations."
503,True,"Andy is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is charged with two life sentences. While he gets in prison, he meets his best friend, Red and the whole movie is about Andy trying to escape and never losing hope (SPOILER ALERT- he eventually does make it out). This is a movie that I felt was perfect in almost every way. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and The Shawshank Redemption is definitely my favorite movie of his. Maybe my favorite thing about The Shawshank Redemption is the ending. Red is walking down the beach and he sees his best friend Andy after all these years and they're both free. A great ending."
504,True,"The Shawshank redemption is about a man who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison. In prison the man makes friends with the inmates while improving the prison's library. He also gives financial advice to the prison security guards and personnel. The theme of this film, The Shawshank Redemption, is about finding friendship and having hope while being at a hard time in your life. Andy Dufresne is play by Tim Robbins and is the main character who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover in a jealous rage. Morgan Freeman also plays a huge part in this film as Ellis ""Red"" Boyd. Ellis or Red as he preferred to be called in the film is Andy's best friend in prison. There are five main plot points in my opinion within this film. These points include when the inmates are betting on the new arrivals, when some of the inmates are re-tarring the roof on one of the buildings, when new library books finally arrive after all of Andy's attempts, and when the warden of Shawshank discovers that Andy has escaped. This films theme is similar to the retelling of the mythical story of ""Perseus"" by author Edith Hamilton. There are several techniques that were used throughout this film but a few really caught my attention. The first technique is a motif, this is the repeated showing of the crow that Brooks rescued and raised. The birds represent a hopefulness of freedom but it also represented the loss of hope after prison. When Brooks is released, he also sets ""Jake"" the crow free and continues to look for him in a park nearby hoping that he will return to him. However, when Jake does not return it represents the loss of hope in Brooks for life after prison. Another technique that attributed to the emotions of the film was the lighting aspects. In the scene after Andy escapes where he is standing in water while it is raining with his arms spread wide, the light is directed down on him with his back in the shadows. This lighting technique in this scene adds to the feeling of triumph, of hope and of freedom. This film absolutely reflects the feeling of hope onto the viewers."
505,True,"A tale that inspires and the emotions that never expires.. The story catches all our imaginations pertaining the character, as the story goes on it gets more deeper with good dialogues and well written,well delivered characters..

And more moved and inspired too..It lives up to its high rank and provides pure entertainment with honest approach.. A well scripted,well handled and well made one..A drama that keeps us into the story till the end of the Movie.. A perfect work from the director and the artists.A MUST WATCH FOR ALL..."
506,True,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, if not really the best. That ""Angel's Prison"" name in Romanian, I agree with it. It has marked my summer vacation last year, I thought about it very much, and how an innocent man can be punished for what he didn't do. I also liked his perseverance, and how he never gave up his ambition to become a free man, legally or not. The sad part was Brook's death, but I understood his decision and agreed with it. I also very much liked the way that Andy and Red bonded over the time Andy spent in prison, and the things he had done for the men in prison, like the library, and the courses he taught, and how he refused to give up his position, that moment when he played the music. A true ""Must See"" movie."
507,True,"It's a pretty long movie of almost 3 hours of which 2.5 hours you shall simply be awed.How can a prison life based movie be this amazing? There is almost no action , no prison breaking(thats the 1st thing that comes to our mind when he hear about prison movies,is'not it?), no shitty scenes just pure drama at its best.You will cry at some moments and smile at some.Most of all ,from my experience of watching over a 1000 movies this is 1 of the very few movie which which could give a brilliant storyline to a good beginning.So watch this movie if you don't want to miss something brilliant in your life.Be a part of history.Thanks for reading!"
508,True,"One of the greatest movie ever I first doubt to watched it I didn't know how good it is then one day i played it and then after I watched it I realize that this is the best movie ever , Its a really good movie and it has a unbelievable story , and u never can guess what will happen in the end of the movie , that what i like in a movie , That I never could guess how this movie will end . Andy is a genius He's mind is brilliant and How he get in to jail , That what I love about this movie and he's stories in prison every thing that happens to him in prison is so interesting that make u want to see this movie many times , and the really good thing in this movie is that beautiful and clever plan of Andy . At first u r looking at a simple guy who owns a bank but at the end you are looking at a genius who is owns a great mind ."
509,True,i watched 10 times but i think they was should recording outside of jail maybe one of the people had a family asking about him or some visitors to jail.. that's will give the movie more reality and when he got out why he did not go to the real killer of her wife? and he had so smart but why he did not tell his friend about run out of jail at last and why he did not marry another woman after he got out? and the man who hang his self how his name still in the roof? and how the black man found his friend name in the roof? how the put him in the same room ? the movie is SO AWESOME but not enough for me im sorry i don't mean any thing about the actors
510,True,"The character Andy have so much influence on me that I wanted to pack my bag to Zihuatanejo and play chess with him... I hope the pacific should be blue for me as well.""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"" that's god damn right. Stephen King's words were so powerful that it exactly replicates the strength of the human mind. Not a man with normal head can create such a master piece. Frank Darabont was no less to Stephen King, he exactly created the character with few directorial touches.The narration was so adorable that the entire movie was well executed by Andy's Colleague. The best words were the final few from Andy ""Hope is a good thing, may be the best of things and no good thing ever dies ....."" If you truly admire human spirit, I bet you will produce some chemical changes in your body.... I cannot say anything about Andy, well he is far beyond my imagination.Well I can write for months about this movie but its not a essay writing, just a review, so I'm stopping now. I hope this movie will be screened in big screens again and I will get chance to watch it in big screen"
511,True,"I saw this movie in 2006 wen I was in college...midnight I was watching this movie... Before this movie I might have seen 100s of movies but never a movie this powerful. A story about Hope, Friendship, Redemption. This movie goes deep into u...it touches Ur soul and u feel real freedom. I always make it a point to watch this movie once or twice a year... It keeps me motivated. Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins and every other character are class. Even after a century this movie will always remember for its acting and will always be a real Hollywood gem. There are so many scenes in the movie one can relate to. Even with no Oscar this movie is worth more than a y Oscar winner. We all are Red searching for people like Andy to get our Redemption!"
512,True,"I have never seen such a film, the story is undoubtedly one of the best ever seen, it's just evil with a mixture of thriller and action ... This leads us away leaves room for our imagination , the development of our common sense ... It's just a philosophical bunch of crap , so bad that I almost vomit , you dare call it a masterpiece ? Let me laugh , it's just a mixture of children's stories , never seen before ... I was reading some reviews and there by chance I came across this film, they say he had an Oscar and all the trimmings . Excuse my subjectivity , but I could not stand this movie , I was bored so I stopped watching in the middle ... How could you look at this epic fail ? This is just to die laughing. I want to say that I found the game player shabby and staging is worse ... The director deserves banishment for life of art to have released such a MASTERPIECE ! Thank you , thank you everyone , I love you <3"
513,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'."" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a ""prison drama"" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value ""Shawshank"" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties.Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro."" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."
514,True,the best story and best actors very nice thinking i can't stop watching it i like the way they thinking and how to be simple person with a very perfect thinking how to make every one think that you are very weak but you are very strong person and very smart person and how to be able to protect yourself how to be able to serve everyone and make everyone serving you how to make friends from your enemies this the best thing and the best of the best the he escaped from the prison it's perfect and the way he got the money after he killed his wife he became free again and how to make everyone your friend it's one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life it's perfect it takes you to another world it takes you inside the movie.
515,True,"This movie title is nothing like the movie. Keep in mind that the movie was based on a book by Stephen King. For a fan of King this is not something that you would expect. The movie has very little action in it, but is about true redemption, which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Personally I love this movie. The way that the cast interacts with each other is really what gives this movie the flare that you need. The prison that it was filmed at is a real prison located in Mansfield, Ohio. It can actually be toured by the general public, as can other aspects of the movie. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life."
516,True,"I have seen the movie first and than read the book and especially in this case, I think it was the right order. I love every moment in the movie, it was made in a very good way. Excellent cast, director and photographer. This is my favorite movie. I watch this movie at least twice in every year and still love it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins brilliantly play in it. They were very good choices for these characters - even they are look like totally different as the book's characters. I think they really enjoy to play their movie characters. Before I have seen this movie someone said to me, it is only a newer ""prison story"". Yes, basically it is ""only"" a prison story. But there is nothing similar to The Shawshank Redemption! I can offer this movie to anyone who like well written stories with very good acting and very good directing."
517,True,"Has to be the best prison movie ever. Yes, it's even better than the Green Mile. I've been putting off watching this movie forever, thinking it was going to be boring and sappy. But it's far from it. This movie wraps you up in its story and it always feels very real due to superb filmmaking. The acting couldn't get any better, and in the end this is one of the most uplifting movies ever made. Yes it's very long, but it without a doubt justifies its length.Based on the Stephen King novel by the same name, it's simply the best movie ever made, it should had won best picture in 1994, and all characters performances are incredible. If you haven't watch it, just do it without thinking about it twice."
518,True,"really its a great movie.......... It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."
519,True,"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in the same movie. Does one need to say more? Morgan Freeman leads this all star cast on and interesting journey of the 1930's to 1950's prison system.The story has been told is such a way that you feel as if you are actually there to see the events take place.There are tears of joy and laughter, tears of sadness at the injustice.This is a movie that requires some patience but have no fear if you pay attention the twists and turns will be plain to see.Tim Robbins is magnificent as a jilted husband who is wrongly accused of his wife's murder.Morgan Freeman is there a movie in which this man doesn't do well in? He is brilliant as an old con who is in Shawshank for murder.Overall this is a brilliant movie and delivers on all counts."
520,True,"This is a must watch movie in every once life,love it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that ""entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie"". this movie give a valuable message ""if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPE"""
521,True,"I apologize to you for my bad English. This is the most amazing movie I watched. Bondage and freedom, has been described in an incredible way. Good movies gather them in the last 30 years, the number 30 does not. I was very impressed with the intelligence of screenwriter. This event is real or not, but the film is absolutely fantastic. I am a Turk. So, ten lines write is too hard. Anyway, for this successful film, I want to thank everyone who contributed. Made me happy, I feel my life has added something. I never get bored and watch over and over again. I think it may forever remain in the TOP250 list. Because, this film beyond time.. ooh I finally finished.."
522,True,"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are inspirational as Andy and Red. I have seen this movie about 30 times, maybe more. This film is full of surprises. It keeps you guessing about Andy's guilt until the end. The prison escape reminded me of the Count of Monte Cristo so it was especially funny that this Dumas book was mentioned in the movie. It is a great film about institutionalization. It also is a good representation of prison life in its time period. It would make a great film to watch for a Criminal Justice class. This is a must see movie for anyone who thinks their life has turned out bad. It can always be worse.In Andy's case it was."
523,True,"The plot is very creative. The part when Andy finally escapes and throughout the whole movie he digging a tunnel to escape. I also enjoy the parody on the TV show ""Family Guy"". If you have Netflix check it out. The episode is called ""Three Kings"". It also contains wonderful parody's of King's other wonderful work ""Misery"", ""Stand by Me"", and also hints at the masterpiece ""The Shining"". They do a great job on ""Shawshank"" and the rest of the stories and they stick to the story lines and change so few very things. Just a few names (To fit the TV show) and a little of the story line to spice things up and make less depressing and little more funny. King is at his best here and has only reached this kind of high point few times before."
524,True,"This review contains spoilers, so spoiler alert!!! This film draws you in from the very beginning; from Tim Robins character coming home catching his wife cheating, to her being murdered. The theme is similar to the movie the Fugitive to me, the only difference was in the film the Fugitive, Harrison Fords character ran in the beginning, in Shaw Shank Redemption, Tim Robins Character runs towards the end, after he suffers abuse being locked up with hardened criminals in prison. I felt sorry for Tim Robins character being falsely accused and having to suffer rape, false imprisonment and lost years. One stand out theme to me in watching this film is you can imprison the man, but you cannot imprison his mind. Tim Robins Character was locked up for years but his mind was free, instead of living inside the prison, Tim Robins Character lives inside his head remembering he is good with numbers and accounting and living inside his head instead of his bad circumstances was his characters saving grace in this film. I would definitely recommend people watch this movie. If you are going through pain, sometimes it helps to see other people going through stuff more worse than you and survive, become a victor instead of a victim, and for that this is my favorite Tim Robins film. Morgan Freeman, was Morgan Freeman, even as a supporting cast he made you feel his presence, his voice, the way he chooses his words makes you can't take your eyes off him. He makes you feel his pain and his friendship with Tim Robins Character. This is a film I can see myself watching again and again when I'm having a bad day. Hope this review helps. Now go watch this movie."
525,True,"I voted 10 out of 10. This movie is truly inspiring. For me, the movie says NEVER GIVE UP and WHEN THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY. The actors portrayed their roles very well. I cannot believe it didn't do well the way it should have compared to some non sense box office movies.I admired the kind of friendship Andy and Red had. I also admired the way Andy made his way to earn the trust of the jail guards and fellow inmates. He is indeed an intelligent man and he used it to gain something that he needed to free himself. I wish I have that kind of intelligence and persistence.The ending is really heartwarming. Seeing two old friends meeting again and ready to start over again. It is just sad that ex-cons are not given the chance to start over nowadays."
526,True,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
527,True,"This movie was the perfect example of those who have patience, and the will to move forward, and fight for what you believe in shall always prevail. Maybe not right then when you want it but it shall happen. Regardless of the plot he went and did what he had to and never once lost his wits and his will. The actors were amazing and one of my favorites in Morgan freeman once again did his thing in capturing the character, and just drawing you into the movie itself. It's Amazing how things from back then, still somewhat hasn't changed in this time era. Maybe someday our judicial system will change for the better who knows. Yet for right now we do with what we have and hope and pray it changes for the better. Awesome awesome movie that I have seen countless times."
528,True,"Amazing Film really loved it, would highly recommend the film to someone who hasn't watched it great acting, amazing storyline, great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman. I'm not really into prison movies that much but this is the best by far! great drama a must watch!. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it."
529,True,"The Shawshank Redemption 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.'So let me get straight to the point! Me searching for a good Morgan Freeman movie as you know he is a good actor and I've near enough watched every movie that he has been in. The tag-line said it all really 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' especially the ending scene where red found the letter quoting 'hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies... your friend Andy.'The movie has absolutely got to be one of my favourite movies. The acting was superb. The story-line was great. The filming was good. You just have to give credit to the director Frank Darabont for doing such an excellent job."
530,True,"Besttechcars.com - Nice movie and great action is one of the starts The Shawshank Redemption.

531,True,"The whole movies are incredible but you'd hate the ending... Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell-block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two."
532,True,"Such a beautiful film, keeping the viewer constantly invested in the stories of the characters, their struggles with coping with prison life and the what the world outside has become.I could write pages and pages on reasons why this film works so well, but I need a few days just to wrap my head around it all.The one thing that I think could have been improved, just personally, is to leave a more ambiguous ending. When Red is talking about how he hopes he will be able to cross the border and see Andy again, connoting the whole ending theme of the film and the bus drives into the distance.That's were they should have left it. Forget the end scene on the beach where they embrace, lovely and uplifting, sure, but too kind. Leaving it with the bus making the viewer hopeful that they will be reunited would have given a much more powerful message.Regardless, this is still a truly astounding film."
533,True,"Amazing story, great characters and very good actors. But only thing that i didn't like was make-up, for example Andy gets 20 years older but that chief guard doesn't older at all and same goes other characters. Location is great, one of the best movie prisons i ever seen. So that is reason why i didn't give a ten, but 9,5 would appropriate. This film definitely deserved at least 3-4 Oscars. Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination at least. Finnish name for this movie terrible, it spoils the entire movie. One of the greatest stories of all time, you have see this."
534,True,"For Foucault, the prison is a creation, that is, in fact, an innovation perfected by reason of punishment since according to him, it was established with the aim of equipping a formation of more affective and usable individuals in society. This same instrument of punishment, which is also an institution of kidnapping, it is contemplated in the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"". In the film, one realizes that prison, as Foucault argued, is contradictory. This institution of kidnapping, which is a reflection of modern society, has a higher re-educative than punitive effect. What can be observed when one of the characters gets his freedom after spending 50 years in prison, he, however, was not successful during its process of adaptation to the external mode of life and society, eventually undermining the very life."
535,True,"This movie the most one of the most greatest movies of all time in my opinion. It features great story, great characters as well as a amusing and sad plot. There are some sad moments in the movie like when the old librarian hung himself because he couldn't live outside of the big house and so on. And there is some feel good moments like when Red got released and when Andy escaped from the prison after twenty years. And it was very frustrating when the student Andy was teaching got shoot because it would prove Andy innocent and for him to be set free. Andy tries his best to fit into Shawshank prison by making little stone statues and a chess set. Where does he get the stone you ask? Well you have to watch it and find out because it is the most genius plan that any prisoner has come up with to escape Shawshank. In conclusion I would absolutely recommend this to any fan of cinema, Steven King, drama, comedy or tragedy then this film is the best for you."
536,True,"One of the best movies ever made. I have watched quite a lot of prison movies but this one takes the prize. I have watched this movie over 4 times the past year and every time the sheer dramatic impact of this movie gets me, regardless that i have watched it so many times. I'm not an expert on films i just enjoy watching them, and in my opinion this is the best movie i have ever watched in my life. Andy Dufrense's struggle as innocent man being imprisoned for 19 years before escaping from Shawshank and finnally claiming his well deserved redemption over all those hard years, some of them including pain emotional and physical but also one of the greatest virtues in humanity, Friendship."
537,True,"(This comment contains a little summary of the film, I didn't mean to spoil the movie for you, but when you are afraid of me spoiling the movie don't read the review.)The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I've seen many films and this one really comes out. I think this movie is 'timeless'. It's an old movie, made in 1994 (I wasn't even born) but it doesn't feel like that when you are watching it. Alright I have to admit that you can see it on the quality of the film and on other things too. It isn't HD or something like that but it gives the film a special character that it needs to be so good. It also doesn't have all those special effects like in Life of Pi, with the tiger Richard Parker who is fully made with the computer, or in the Avengers. So it isn't spectacular in that way. I think the movie is spectacular in the way it's built up and in its plot line.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in the Shawshank State Penitentiary because he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he gets to know smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and soon they become friends. Red smuggles a rock hammer in prison for Andy to make 'chess pieces'. He also gets several posters and other stuff. He makes his chess pieces, but that's not the only reason for buying his hammer. He also has some other plans. First Andy works in the washing room and sometimes he gets raped by Bogs. One day the prison needs some men to work on the roof and with a little skill Andy can arrange some beers for his fellows. They start to like him and they accept him as a friend. Slightly Andy works himself up so he can do the accountancy of the director of the prison. He decides to swindle the director and he makes up an whole new person with every legit paper a human needs. After the release of Brooks Andy takes over the library and he gives it a new boost. He receives new money for books and he can expand it. His life in prison goes well but he doesn't lose his hope and faith in a better future even though Red has warned him that hope is a dangerous thing. When you want to know the end and the rest of the film you really need to buy and watch it because after the first time there is a big chance that you will love the film and that you are going to watch it more than once. I think that every single bit of the film perfectly fits. The music, the photography, the story There is a reason why this film is standing on number 1 in the IMDb top 250 and why it has 7 Oscar nominations."
538,True,"its different form other movie.... also have a unique story,....my favorite actors are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.......so them take this story to a successful movie in the plant and make this movie to world best movie of all kind.....also commencement is bit boring ...... he was a good man however he had a mistake to her wife.....he attempt to murder his wife for bad behavior ....then he failed to prove it is a mistake of angry at the courthouse......unfortunately he went to prison for until death.... finally he figure out to escape from the prison ..... he got a mastermind plan to escape form the prison...he work hard to success this plan..... this is the Summary of this story .....i recommended all one to watch this movie .....every one must watch the whole story it is a marvelous story.....best movie ever watched..thanks!!!!"
539,True,"I'm not one to judge a book by it's cover, or in this case a film, but I had no interest in watching this film. This was mainly due to the fact that my boyfriend loves it and we are usually on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to choosing films. But this is the one film that we can agree on. It has everything that he likes, (crime, violence and rebellion) whilst also having everything that I love in a film (a well thought out story, unexpected turns of events, great actors). Films are like a passion to me, and The Shawshank Redemption is in a league all of it's own. Tim Robbins created such a character that we all think we know but his deception and rebellion towards the end of the film intrigues me and makes me respect Andy so much more. ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"", the tag-line of the film holds a deep significance as nobody suspected a thing from Andy whilst the years passed by in prison, yet his ulterior motives fuelled by hope helped him in his quests!"
540,True,"This film is truly a work of art a master piece one of the greats. This film is not just so amazing because of the amazing story (based of the Stephen king book) but also because of the amazing acting and directing. It's about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker that gets convicted of double murder and is sentenced to life term at shaw-shank were he meats Ellis read redding ( Morgan freeman ) who picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure manly to the fact that they have a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favour with the wardens and guards."
541,True,"This movie has all of the aspects you would expect of a great film. Based on Stephen King's short story, this tale of hope and loss, friendship and betrayal is nothing shy of magical. Your heart bleeds for Andy through his troubles with the sisters and then sings when he is finally free. You feel the hatred for the warden and the screws, while crying for the lost life of Brooks. I have seen so many different movies in my life and can honestly say, 100%, without a doubt that this beautifully crafted piece of art is hands down my all time favorite. I can watch Tim Robbins stroll through the yard and listen to Morgan Freeman narrate over and over. If you came to my house right new with a bag of popcorn and some wine with a copy of this in your hand, we would be besties for life."
542,True,"When I'm talking to my friends about movies, we always talk about this one. Because everyone should have seen it. It is a must see movie and you won't be disappointed. The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies with a great story and acting work. I admire everyone that helped working on this movie because they did a really good job. I love everything about the movie, from the beginning till the end. This movie is a movie that reach you when watching it, it gives you special feelings about the story and makes you think about it. If you want to know the details and why I write this, just watch the movie. I can only say one thing to everyone who reads this, Watch the movie! And you will feel the same way about the movie as me."
543,True,"I love this movie, a masterpiece, one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King book with me and has unexpected miracles. The actors are brilliant, I have not seen a movie of this quality makes. Morgan Freeman stars in one of his greatest roles, and Robbins, no doubt, done his best acting. Who has not seen this wasting time. Hopefully the studios and producers stop making movies just to raise money, and be dedicated to do this kind of movies that are in the story. No wonder this movie was the head of the ranking 250 of IMDb. Again, I recommend you see this movie, so no movies today.Thanks for this excellent IMDb page is very complete and is full of information, the application is also excellent for mobile phones."
544,True,"This is a amazing movie. It is one of my favorite movies. It depicts the story of Andy Dufresne, a famous banker who go to Shawshank for murder of his wife. This movie depicts friendship of two different persons having different views, how it grows. He was very intelligent man as he made his friendship with corrupted Warden of the Prison yet it was only one sided. In the end, when he escapes from the prison, he takes down the whole life of Warden and his colleagues. After few days, his friend Red also gets out of jail and travels to Texas and meet his friend Andy.As a whole this movie was good and even it is the best. It deserves to be number 1. I wonder how this movie not get Oscar for Best motion picture of the year 1994."
545,True,"the movie was good but not as expected... movie was slow before halftime and also later after halftime. characters portrait was appreciable,life of jail shown was real and cruelty within jail too.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing. Morgan freeman's acting was good as usual.Tim Robbins performance was good. cinematography,direction everything was superb. every character shown in the movie was perfect. perfect timing of everything. hope to see such movie's in future...."
546,True,"This movie will make you think about short life really are. Tim Robins who play a wrongly prisionized man which spend over 20 years of his life in prison for something that he did not do. He makes the most of the situation and even improves the living standard in Shawshank (the prison). You should also watch this brilliant movie to hear the best story teller in the world, Morgan Freeman. The way he speaks in a slow and convincing way, is perfect. It is also a must watch because you becomes very positive to life after watching it. Suddenly your own problems does not seem so big anymore. To summerize it, it is a great movie, with amazing actors performances and a brilliant manuscript and regi. Do watch it you will not regret it."
547,True,"A friend of mine told me 2 years ago about this film, A said maybe it's boring but after I seen it I was speechlessThe greatest movie set in a prison I've ever seen! Its full of courage from Tim Robbins to survive prison and no matter what the differences between him and Morgan Freeman and all the other prisoners, no matter what violence comes up, no matter their crimes, no matter what crazy or illegal things they have to do to survive prison, no matter what the warden does to Tim Robbins, together prison is awesome and they can redeem themselves. Movies like this show what would happen if prisoners accept people's differences and redeem themselves from their crimes and that's good thing because people don't need to act like idiots in prison. Despite the graphic violence in this movie in the beginning, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman used friendship to forget prison and made each other good people and they were great people! Whoever does NOT like this movie is a bully and needs lighten up because this is a light-heart movie of teaching you the lessons of prison."
548,True,"This is my number one favorite movie. I can watch this several times a year! Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship and how far those to things can get you. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again..."
549,True,"an awesome movie i have ever seen... Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is a novella by Stephen King, from his collection Different Seasons (1982), subtitled Hope Springs Eternal. It was adapted for the screen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture.[1] In 2009, it was adapted for the stage as the play The Shawshank Redemption.[2]The novella's plot line is heavily based on God Sees the Truth, But Waits by Leo Tolstoy. This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope."
550,True,"There is really not lots of movies that i can really be forgetful, i see lots of mistakes, and moral things of lots of great movies, because i -maybe i an bad- analyze everything that is happening around, is pretty hard, and very remarkable to a movie, to accomplish the sense of freedom -this has two meanings- that this movie could, i really could forget about insubstantial problems, at and after watching the movie, it gives great advice about moral interrogations, and life itself, a pretty neat movie, authentic, and not boring at all, i wonder how it have been, without the cultural references that i already knew about the film. If you have some spare time, what are you waiting for?"
551,True,I don't like prison movies that much but this was the best prison movie I have ever seen. I like ever thing about it. The acting was really good. ******spoiler alert ******* I liked it when Andy is escaping the prison . I like how he he made the whole on the wall to escape that was good I also like when the two friends are reunited at the end of the movie. This movie was really good.i don't like writing much but I will write the ten lines I need for this review cause this movie was really good. I don't agree with some these movies that are in the IMDb top 250 but with this I do. I don't know if it should be number 1 but it was really good. If you want to watch a good prison movie then watch this one cause this is the best prison movie I have ever seen. I recommend this movie to everybody to see it. So if you haven't seen this movie go and watch it you will probably like more or as much as i did. You have to see this movie at least once in your whole entire life time.
552,True,"The film is beautiful and interesting and fun, thanks to the director and staff representatives and photographers.

553,True,"This is prolly one of the best movies i've ever seen in my whole life! The acting is so incredible and same goes with the plot. This movie gets 10/10 from me because the ending part when Morgan Freeman gets outta jail to and meets up with that other guy is just breath taking. Morgan Freeman does a really great job in this movie because he plays this guy that isn't a bad guy but a he still keeps his cool. Same goes with the main char that really tries to tell everyone that hes innocent. This is a movie that i think everyone should at least watch once in a lifetime. Yes some of you may think that I'm overdoing it, but i promise you this is a great bad ass movie!Review from - Labinot Sadrija"
554,True,"The film kept me going throughout the whole movie! I couldn't believe how the production was able to pull such a great film off. I even talk to a few of my colleagues about this film and every single one gave nothing but the up most respect and feedback that this film should have been nominated more then the few awards it received. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors and mentors of this age and time. I really look up to him for inspirational feedback and knowledge to help me as an young artist to better develop my craft and skills. I have grown to love this film over and over with time, this have became one of my favorite and best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman this is one of your best performance and I am truly happy to know that your work is still going."
555,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is good movie, I Think This is best movie but not as much as batter than other i like this movie but some time we think batter is not batter then other, When This Movie will started is awesome some started part but when between part come that time it was some what boring.so for that i give him 7 rates other wise i increase it . now the ending part of this move will be also good but this movie is contain some best topic and awesome since. i want to say i am from India but i Like Hollywood movie,so this is good movie as my think.my review. i will give him 7 start from 10. so, this review from founder of I Tech PassionI Tech Passion.com"
556,True,"It's simply one of the best movies off all time. All is perfect: Screenplay, cinematography,acting,production...The performances are of the highest quality- every character is portrayed in such a way as to enhance the authenticity of the film and give it true life. The most complete movie that I've ever seen. I really recommend this movie to anyone. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. Once again, in my opinion,this is simply the best movie ever made,with so many moments burned forever in my memory.... I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. An absolute masterpiece."
557,True,"Absolutely the perfect movie, taking you through all your emotions, insisting on making you feel your hope, anger, disgust, compassion, love, hate and pride. Genuinely moving with a voice-over to die for. The narration takes you on a journey of epic storytelling, whilst still moving you to tears. Morgan Freeman delivers the most powerful performance, I think, of his career as the very likable Red, while the then unknown to me, Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance of an ill justified innocent who gets caught up in a web of in-prison politics and corruption. The schemes of Tim's character, Andy Dufresne with his wizardry with the abacus and knowledge of the tax system befriends the prisoners and the officers and the smug look on his face is to die for when he get his inmates a bottle of beer each to drink in the sunshine. How this didn't win an Oscar, I do not understand."
558,True,"Is film is a timeless classic, there are no two ways of saying it. It doesn't have explosions, mass deaths or laugh out loud comedy. Yet it still appeals to everyone. It has a simple and well thought out story line with a very simplistic narrative voice over, but with it being so simple - it makes it so brilliant. This film is the best example to everyone, that you don't need explosions to create a masterpiece. Just Morgan Freeman and some casual swearing.Many would say that because it isn't exiting all the time it isn't a good film. But 'The Shawshank Redemption' creates it's own category, were you will never be able to compare it to another films."
559,True,"Can never imagine Shawshank could keep this secret for such a long time. When his friend subsided when leaving the poison, he never quit his dream. When the poison leader forced him to do illegal things, he compromised to survive, because there is a dream deeply rooted in his mind. A man is never broken down if only his mind is strong. Sometimes we consider desire as a kind of forbidden thing where wicked things happened, however in other point, desire is a kind of driving force. I think the director is trying to convey to the audience that there is a kind of force that can drive people to success. We should use this force to help us."
560,True,"Shawshank was one of the best movie I've ever watched. The message of hope is undeniably one of the best themes and the director does a masterful job at delivering it so patiently and yet with precision and passion and in one of the most inspiring ways a movie can.Andy and red are skillfully acted and the narration by Morgan Freeman is intensely touching. Its a shame they did not get recognized by the academy, but they should by now realize they were part of a masterpiece. most movies fade in interest when one watches them more than once, not Shawshank. The story stays strong, the message ever more alive and fresh, and the acting truly is one of the best.Thank you Frank for making this movie."
561,True,"A story of brotherhood, revenge, trials and tribulation. A man is imprisoned and the story goes along with the decades he spends behind the bars of an old and corrupt prison with some of the best characters written and some of the best actors portraying those characters. This movie was just put together right. There is no doubt you will love this film and love the characters. I rated this title a 10 and barely anything else rates this with me. The Green Mile would be another that was put together in such a way there is no way to NOT love it! One of the very best movies made from the stories of Stephen King. Without a doubt one of the movies I'd want with me while stranded on a deserted island. You will love this movie unless you are dead."
562,True,"Yes I'm 15 years old I've seen this movie once and that was almost a year ago. After seeing this movie for the first time in my life I felt like a changed person. Yes everyone has hard times but this movie showed me not only the power of hope but the power of friendship. It's funny my name is Andy my dad names me this because of the shawshank redemption and now I feel blessed to have that name. When Andy is brought to prison my first thought was he was a bad or even evil person. Over time that calmly slips away. I think what makes this the #1 movie of all time is the redemption part. Yes there are plenty of good movies about hope and change, but the great films such as shawshank convince you there will be a bad or sad ending and it doesn't happen. I will show this to my kids whenever that happens I will wage tell there my age though not because of the violence or the rape or language but because when they see this I want them to understand it and love it and hopefully change them."
563,True,"The Shawshank Redemption has always been one of my favorite films to watch. I was introduced to this movie by my dad, who has always been a huge fan of the film. I didn't think at first I would have liked the movie, but I was wrong. Tim Robbins plays a character called Andy; who was sentenced to prison for committing a crime he never committed. Tim Robbins did a remarkable job of playing Andy. Andy had this attitude about him that captured the audience in a special way. He was always so calm, and although he had been put in prison for something he didn't do and, was treated horribly by some of his fellow inmates; he still remained a humble individual. He didn't let these actions of others affect his life. He knew he didn't do anything wrong. He knew what kind of a man he was, and he wanted out of prison. Morgan Freeman played ""Red"" a character whom Andy befriended in prison. Just like the audience watching the film, Red was always drawn to Andy. Andy always kept Red guessing of what was to come. I always enjoyed the relationship shared between Andy and Red. It's the kind of friendship you'd want with someone-even given the circumstances in which they were living. Eventually, Andy devised a plan and escaped Shawshank. Red eventually was let out of prison and went on to find Andy. This was another one of my favorite parts of the movie; not only the fact that Andy escaped from the prison in which he didn't belong but Red and him were reunited. I think in the end despite the fact that Red and Andy were prison inmates; everyone was on their side. They had never really seemed like they belonged in prison. They seemed like they were good people. Above all I believed after so long some people just learn their lesson and deserve to be sent home. This film is truly amazing and never gets old for me. There will never be another one quite like it."
564,True,"Andy Dufresne, a successful banker is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. At first, it is hard for him to get used to it on the inside, but when he meets Red, the guy who can get it for you, they become friends and they work their problems out together. The guards seem to like Andy after he helped Captain Hadley with his tax issues. They give Andy more privileges. They let him write letters, help the guards during Tax Season, build the Shawshank Prison Library, and teach other prisoners education. But when the new inmate Tommy, who was one of Andy's classmates for reading, is shot by Captain Hadley, Andy feels it's time for him to escape with the help of his friend Red. He tells Red that when he escapes, he plans to move down to Zihuatanejo. He tells Red that when he finally is released from the prison, he wants him to move with him. Red agrees. So then on a stormy night, Andy used a rock hammer to tunnel through the cement wall. Then he crawls through a sewer tunnel 500 yards long out to a creek. Then shortly afterwards, Captain Hadley is taken to prison after shooting the inmate Tommy, and Norton the Warden shoots himself after he sees Captain Hadley being taken away. Then the day comes, when they release Red from the prison, and like he promised Andy, he got a ticket to ride a bus down to Zihuatanejo, where he finally gets to meet his friend Andy again."
565,True,"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him ""a particularly remorseless and icy man."" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. ""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,"" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. ""I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.""Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards with skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the first time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift to his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as ""a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.""Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. (""You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow,"" he says about this. ""I had to come to prison to be a crook."") He also makes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's loudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The film has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it sustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish Red's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing Andy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding presence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is especially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the prison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his ruefulness. ""Only guilty man in Shawshank,"" he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run deep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed denouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are a sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's is the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he ages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One of Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once contained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient, writing weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants. Mr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut, works in much the same quietly persistent way. ""The Shawshank Conspiracy"" takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall subtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre. In the end, like Andy and Red, it gets to where it wanted to go.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional violence, including a scene that discreetly suggests homosexual rape.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" by Stephen King; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Richard Francis- Bruce; music by Tom Newman; production designer, Terence Marsh; produced by Niki Marvin; released by Columbia Pictures.

566,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is very entertaining, and quite possibly the greatest prison film of all-time.Based on the Stephen King's novel of the same name, the film shows what happens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he is ordered to prison for a double murder that he did not commit. Much of the film story revolves around Andy and the friendships he makes in the barbarous environment that is a prison.It the best films from the 90s but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" for me trails ""The Lion King"",""Forest Gump"", ""Pulp Fiction"" & possibly even ""Leon: The Professional"" for best films of 1994. As well as this the film, can be in some parts slow and be a bit boring.Despite this, the film is enjoyable and has some scenes that truly hit you hard (Brooks' release). It is good but overrated"
567,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.""The Shawshank Redemption"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later.

568,True,"Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture.

569,True,"Shawshank Redemption is a very real film, beginning to tell a story of an "" innocent "" person but make us think that he committed the crime since the beginning . The main actor was convicted for a crime he did not but that from the beginning he was planning his escape from prison , trying to get in trust with the chief of the prison and the guards also well felicitated the realization of his plan . In addition to planning his escape he helped a lot in prison who was convicted, to people that it was with him, and also built a library. Spent many years working to excavate the tunnel to escape , managed to free himself from that place leaving evidence that the head of the prison was a criminal who was arrested by the police . Before his escape , he left some clues for "" best friend "" with which he was sentenced for them to meet when the second out of prison . This story is very exciting and for those who did not see this movie should do it because it makes us think about our life and we have to cherish every moment ."
570,True,"Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie done right. With both the story and technical aspects of the film at the highest caliber, it delivers a powerful tale that is timeless. Star Morgan Freeman gives a great performance, but Tim Robbins undeniably delivers. From the lighting to score, one cannot help but appreciate this fine example of a powerful adaptation at its finest. It is a beautiful piece of history and takes its place among the best. Even the pacing of the story is well placed to give a sense of hopelessness within the prison, but not dragging on and prolonging confinement. The creativity and originality behind this leaves viewers in awe of a great film."
571,True,"This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."
572,True,"To me this is one of the best told prison movies ever made. After watching the Blue Ray Version - it is more than a prison movie too. While Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the support cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good role in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing being converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from that. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont directs and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the director pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along with when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the prison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as the warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this picture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this well done, they would all be best pictures."
573,True,"this is one of the most incredible movies ever. it is very well done and has a lot of suspense and drama. Morgan freeman is incredible, as always and never stops to amaze. my favorite movie ever. i recommend this movie to everyone. when red doesn't kill himself but instead says that red was here i was so happy. and that whole thing where they meet on the beach at the end is so amazing and i was thrilled. it is perfectly acted and done with exquisite directing. i am so in love with this movie because it is so perfect and incredible. the authenticity is incredible. and how can i write a review without mentioning the greatest twist ever? he escapes and you are like ""what?!"""

575,True,"i have watched this movie so many times i just can not remember how many time i saw this legendary movie i can say just one word to this amazing movie just amazing. The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Release date: September 23, 1994 (USA) Director: Frank Darabont Adapted from: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption Story by: Stephen King Characters: Andy Dufresne, Warden Norton, Brooks Hatlen, More Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation."
576,True,"I watched this tonight for the first time in a few years. It really is superb! Redemption is such a good word. I love the groundwork that goes into the best executed escape ever - the 'this is how I did it' bit is so pleasing!! It's so satisfying to watch when everyone gets their just desserts!! I really like that the story is told through the eyes of red. I like the idea of institutionalization, and the struggle that prisoners face when they leave prison - Brooks story is so sad. I love the pure bliss of Tim Robbins when he does something good for his inmates. And I love the end, so perfect and happy and hopeful! Never disappoints :)"
577,True,"This move is remarkable every time I watch it. The cinematography, music, character development and everything the movie captures only happens so often. In the beginning you watch as Anthony's wife cheats on him and implies he's the murderer. When in court you have mixed feelings. Did he murder his wife and lover? all the evidence is there. Though how Anthony presented himself shows what kind of character he is. As he enters Shawshank, I personally got a sickening feeling of what he was about to experience. Though excitement too. How was this man going to survive a prison. When Morgan Freeman's Character ( Red ) enters the story, he speaks so much of routine and what the life. Breaking reality from fantasy when he says "" There's no fairy tales in Shawshank "" implying everything you fear what would happened. Did happen. Although, one of the most uplifting parts is with Anthony breaks free. He sends a letter to Red telling him "" Hope is a good thing. It's never wrong to hope. Good things don't die"" This message speaks so profoundly, after Brooks death and the dependency on Shawshank. That message speak so profoundly. This movie is more than a 10/10. It captures everything it wants and needs to then some. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good film."
578,True,"This is one of the best movies I ever watched. Everything is perfect. It's one those movies that you must see once in your life.So, so, so good. The adaptation of the Stephen King novel is so entertaining, filled with interesting dialogue and plot twists. A pretty much perfect prison film. Great performances by Robbins and Freeman. One moment really got to me: the moment when Andy crawls out of the sewer tunnel and stares up at the sky in the rain. Such a glorious moment of triumph, I wanted to stand up and scream ""Yes!"". This movie truly depicted that prison life in the fifties was just as hard for new prisoners as it is implied today. The movie didn't sugar coat Andy's prison life. A great movie full of great writing and performances that the first time you watch it, it will instantly be fortified as a great movie classic"
579,True,excellent movie in all aspects . What more one need from a movie .Heart throbbing drama with wonderful performances ever seen on a cinema screen .no flaws whatsoever with an amazing ending . cinematography n story goes hand in hand with powerful direction . Amazing drama with a suspenseful end . I watched the whole movie without getting bored for 1 second . music of the movie is better than great . thumbs up for the performance of Tim Robbins who does even better work from Morgan freeman .It is a flawless movie .With no boring scenes or long talking sessions this movie is a ten on ten . loved it in every way . there is no way that anyone can hate a drama flick like this . in last its a Masterpiece of Masterpiece .
580,True,"Frank Darabont's work is amazing in this movie let alone Stephen king, incredible ... Since Tim Robbins (Andy) is in that car at night until Morgan freeman (Red) arrives at the Mexican beach all a thrill, intrigue you see on the screen. Geologist's hammer, the Rita Hayworth poster hanging on the wall in a miserable prison cell Shawshank an incredible idea of Stephen. For my part the movie is the best thing and seen the movie that hooked me more of screen a movie with 14 years spent enough. A life lesson that shows what can happen to oneself from one day to the other just to make a nonsense. Finally, Some 20 years turned into 2 hours, I recommend this movie to movie lovers. Greetings.German!"
581,True,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?"
582,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
583,True,"The first time, i saw this movie, i had a big smile in my face, because of the excellent ending of the movie. It's a high Quality movie in every sense. I do like that story, the writing is great. I think, the movie is even better than the book of Steven King. The directing is great. The cut is perfect, the art direction is great. The Sound and Soundtrack fits perfect into the movie. I don't know even one aspect, why i should not like it. It's the all time number one for me. That means, it is my absolute first place. The perfect movie! It's a great film about humanity under bad conditions. So everyone can see, that even in bad places is humanity. And even if there are bad People who want to break humanity between others with their might and power, they can't really destroy it. And the movie knocks down facades of deceitfulness. I like that! Sorry, if my English is bad. It's not my mother language. :) Greetings. :)"
584,True,"Robbins and Freeman have the juice as actors to make figuring out whether Andy and Red really did it a riveting guessing game, especially if you're a sucker for prison melodramas. Writer Frank Darabont (The Fly II), in his feature-directing debut, doesn't skimp on the caged-bird clichés, sadistic and sentimental, but he plays enough hardball with the formula to evoke memories of such goodies as Cool Hand Luke, Birdman of Alcatraz and Riot in Cell Block II.Stephen King wrote the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film is based. (Andy's cell is bedecked with a poster of Hayworth in all her Gilda glory.) You can find the novella in a 1982 King collection, Different Seasons, along with a story, ""The Body,"" that became the, basis for the 1986 Rob Reiner smash Stand by"
585,True,"I decided to make a review about a fantastic film, which I personally think it should deserve a lot better, it was forced to be re-released to reach more than the budget. The Shawshank redemption a movie directed by Frank Darabont The Shawshank Redemption is an American drama film made by writer Stephen King from the beginning, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles. The film is about the successful banker Andy ( Tim Robbins ) who is wrongly convicted for murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life. This is one of the toughest prisons in the United States during the 1940s. There he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) as they quickly becomes very good friends. Years after years Andy just gets more and more famous among the guards, and the prisoners, and it ends with Andy helps a guard to get $ 25,000 as a gift. Then the police- officer Norton realizes that Andy might be useful, so he started taking care of the prison economy. It causes him to get control of what happens in the prison and it gives him great opportunities to escape from the prison. The film has a strong and important purpose that you should never give up and always have hopes for what will happen. That trust is a big impact on relationships, The film can be viewed by anyone of any age and it is a very good and interesting movie. It defiantly deserves better because it is a touching movie and very inspiring."
586,True,"Excellent inspirational movie to watch... extreme worth to spent time on this Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame."
587,True,"This movie is just awesomely brilliant. Okay, English teachers may not like that description, but simply put, this movie is one great movie. This movie is about a prison in Maine named Shawshank. A wealthy banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is arrested, charged, and convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. He claims that he did not do it, but the evidence points directly to him. He claims that he is innocent, but so does everybody else in Shawshank. Andy, though, proclaims his innocence right through to the end. He says ""the only time I became crooked was when I came to Shawshank"".The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from the Stephen King novel ""Rita Heywood and the Shawshank Redemption"", and as is typical for Stephen King, the horror comes not from the supernatural but from the natural. The horror here is of being thrown into prison an innocent man, and then never being able to leave because of the corruption all around. Andy is clearly innocent by the closing stages of the movie, but by that time he is such a key element to the Warden's plans, that there is no way he is ever going to be allowed to leave. Ebert speaks of the horror of time and of daily routine here, but more so there is the sense of alienation. Once one is inside the walls one can never really leave. When one prisoner, Brooks Halten (James Whitmore) is released, he kills himself due to the fact that he is free. Red (Morgan Freeman) says when he is finally released, that without the strict routine of the prison system and with the freedom of daily life, he just cannot cope.Andy is different, he has hope, and he retains this hope right through until the end. We do not see the big picture until the end of the movie, when we are revealed all, but Andy remains calm, patient, and resolute, knowing that in the end he is going to be free. He is also an opportunist, he sees an opportunity and he takes it, and when he does, he gains the friends that he needs to survive in the prison. He is not a pushover, for when the sisters seek to violate them, he fights, and he fights brutally, but he knows that in the end he will be out and he puts up with it.This movie is about hope. It is not a fantasy: Red says ""if this was a fantasy then he would have fought them off and everything would have been fine, but it is not."" This is real and King has pulled no punches. Yet also the hope is there; we see real characters with real fallibilities. Even Andy falls occasionally and is blackmailed into submission, but he has that hope and he always looks forward to freedom."

589,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red ""Ellis Redding"", he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall: 9/10"

I saw this movie rate 9.2 but I think this movie is highest rating movie. Normally I am a programmer but love to saw lot of movie. This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"
592,True,"Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. One of the greats motion picture I have ever seen. There are 0 flaws to this film. And I counted. This film is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. If I could give it more than 10 I would."
593,True,"I thought that this film is epic. It is beautiful, sad and heart-warming. I thought that the character were brilliant and the actors portrayed them very well. Our knowledge of Andy's innocence is painful to watch as he spends most of his life in prison, but I loved the ending, and I believe that a film with a good ending always makes it better because you leave the film on a good note. I thought that Morgan Freedman and Tim Robbins made the film what it was because as actors they were given the building blocks to bringing the character to life, and I thought they did it brilliantly. I congratulate them strongly."
594,True,"What more can you ask for? A spectacular cast, a gripping score and a strong plot all contribute this film's massive success. Easily Frank Darabont's greatest achievement, The Shawshank Redemption creates so much atmosphere, and forces you to feel a whole spectrum of emotions not explored in most films. Although sometimes exaggerated (as to be expected from a Stephen King source), the film deals without a lot of serious themes from the outset. The eventual revelation of Andy's wrongful conviction is a great turning point in the story, and gives us even more of a reason to root for our protagonist. Overall, the direction and acting are masterful, with such power put into Thomas Newman's score to send shivers through your body, there's not much else to expect from this movie: A triumph!"
595,True,"This movie is simply astonishing. Must watch movie in a lifetime. The work of Morgan Freeman is the most brilliant from my views. But all The credit and magic is goes to the Amazing Director of the Movie, I also Watched his movie 'The Green Mile' Which is simply amazing like this one but still it is not interesting or emotional like the Shawshank.In the end Shawshank movie i was simply full of emotions in my life for the first time by watching a movie . Otherwise i did int think so that some Movie or Actor or Director can make me so soft hear-ted. Well For the movie, just amazing . You will not regret after watching this movie.Oh my Advice, Watch it in on the Big screen with headphones on and no disturbance at all , then you will realize how good is the Shawshank Redemption."
596,True,"There are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why some (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic, Shawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost pitiless to do a ""normal"" review of the film for by now almost everyone out there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" a movie that after watching it makes you feel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either physically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me that there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a film that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of the points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding and virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.Shawshank Prison: is there anything more foreboding than the flying camera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of ""fresh fish"" arrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary yet sadly home to many convicted men.Morgan Freeman as Red: introducing the world to the now overused but never better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the role of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone feels an affection towards.Thomas Newman's score: crafting a score that ranges from the haunting to the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true musically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners of film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music kicks in as Brook's leaves prison.The Script: turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour plus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what Darabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by a wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples include: ""Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has"" or ""The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell and those bars slam home that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"".The story: The journey Tim Robbins's Andy takes over 20 years in Shawshank is one we the viewer's feel like we take to. Never more so have we felt the sweat of prison workshops like we do here, the feeling of relief in times of outdoor recess or the fear of guards lying in wait to throw us in the ""hole"" or react with their batons. Shawshank is more than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope, loss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best of lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say one thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank first entered our world. Shawshank redemption is the best ""bro-mance"" tale we will ever see, a tale that we will never forget and a movie that will never grow tired or old.5 Rita Hayworth posters out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
597,True,"The Shawshank Redemption which was released in 1994 is one of the greatest classic in the world's film industry. & it is also an excellent work of Morgan Freeman. In this movie, the crude, naked and true picture of an American jail has been revealed with a surprise. Threre is also an important message about intelligence of a man. This movie tells us that not a single man's intelligence is negligible. Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Roger Ebert suggested that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy Dufresne's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.Angus C. Larcombe suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or even in freedom, based on one's outlook on life."
598,True,"I do not know why I missed this film when it first premiered. Perhaps it was in the decade in which I lived under a rock. Nevertheless, I did not first see this film until 2007, and although I'd heard of it, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it was a Stephen King adaptation and, honestly, I've never really been much of a King fan, although it seems that I keep watching many of the films adapted from his stories. (Seriously... The Langoliers? The butt worms. WTF?!) Still, I took to Shawshank with little trepidation, allowing the story to unfold as it was meant, and I was hooked within minutes. Afterwards, I did what any good Shawshank fan should do, I watched it again. Robbins' and Freeman's performances were incredible. The story, well told, and the standard King-style twist, surprisingly unanticipated. Little to say,this movie immediately became my all-time favorite, and I happily enjoy watching it whenever it comes available."
599,True,"this is a good movie This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
600,True,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best prison break i have ever seen. This is the story of freedom, the story of hope and friendship. This movie is like a art because it is a combination of purely amalgamated of various emotions like friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. simply it is a extraordinary creation by Frank Darabont and panned by Stephen King.If we talk about the cast of the movie then Freeman, who is simply a great actor, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Morgan Freeman has griped the narration aspects its why the has gained Oscar for best actor in leading role. On the other side Tim Robbins had played as Andy tremendously well but sometimes he is unable to form bridge to audience. The story of Brooks is very emotional and heartbroken. At the time Brooks hung himself he carves in the wood ""Brooks was here"" in his apartment and then Red added to it ""And so was Red"". The creation of this types of scenes will surely add a step further to won Oscar in best cinematography. I love that film because it had great impact on emotions and hopes. We can say that the Shawshank envelops friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. The film contain very good quote that ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" Andy Dufresne. I want to express that if you don't love the Shawshank Redemption than you are beyond the bound of Redemption. After the watching this movie a question upswing in my mind that ""why are these men in jail?"" but after that i realize that everything matters that is the situation.So it is awesome movie and such type of movie should't be unseen. So watch this movie very precisely and i am sure that the movie will pour it's fraction of greatness in your life."
601,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars.It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.over all it was an amazing movie."
602,True,"The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells the story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to deceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense through both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events imaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with the main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event (Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films to action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally connected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the primary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by Stephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film; however the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense something that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific camera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the characters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy and the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film. The first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene, which shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his face, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is critical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at the moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is locked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and then enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join Andy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature cannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that Andy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape. The camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers feel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry room, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of his body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the camera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of the movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out. Darabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the sensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of freedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these events give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the camera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still manages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these choices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all bond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie which draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely suspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up. The camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while simultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of the horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up to imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels. The camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next suspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that Andy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf to shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this point, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the warden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with them, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads the audience to anticipationwondering what will be said next. Another great example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point of view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building suspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took a journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself, leaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows Brooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into the walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the writing on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung himself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal movement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered that Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In this instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the book version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is finishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search of the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense because of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but never shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find the special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands, and the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique rock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a group of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the anticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received seven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie has not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that doesn't take away from its brilliance."
603,True,"""Get busy living or get busy dying"" An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through. And what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best Picture. It's really too bad that most everyone got swept by that chocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed ""better"" that year, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even greater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of the most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER hyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the WORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn well, eats it too!). Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life. It's like I quoted back at the top of this review, you better ""get busy living, or get busy dying"". It don't get more black and white than that. Your choice. A true cinematic inspiration.

604,True,"the Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen! defiantly worth the watch!! it is so amazing how Andy spent years having patience to dig out that tunnel so he can escape. And the scene where the librarian hangs himself because he doesn't know what to do with his life touched my heart, it is truly amazing how one can adapt to an environment no matter how bad to the point if they leave there lost. I defiantly recommend this to everyone! it is amazing to look into the life of a prisoner and see and in a way experience what they did in prison, to watch Andy progress through the years and to change things in the prison is amazing. and I defiantly love the chess pieces it gives the storyline a great prospective of the character. I love how Andy affects each prisoner and how it shows that when Ellis finally gets parole that he actually goes to the place Andy asked him too. absolutely amazing!"
605,True,"I thought the movie was great. All of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. It tells the story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek."
606,True,"this movie so touch full to every man and women heart i learn something today's i touch something today the freedom we don't have here ,, when i watch the movie i learn to not be afraid to do anything i love and say it without to be afraid life is once and i will live it . that's i'm have to do the human being is the most beautiful and incredible creature he earn the right to be anything and i promise in my deep down in my heart to be free and do what ever what i like and say what ever i need m n. I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
607,True,"A Review of The Shawshank RedemptionThis film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term prisoners, but its real theme is one of hope. It draws us in quickly with the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband. However, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan Freeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even though the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence. He spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he meets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of getting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the first things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as a free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has difficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called ""the sisters"" and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows his worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy Brown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates with beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates feel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the warden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided Andy with protection from the ""sisters"", allowed him to fix-up the library, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school diplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that proceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a bleak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and blue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty years, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that all of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for these inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own horrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous who stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one person who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this Andy maintains a hope for the future that ""they"" can't touch. The Shawshank Redemption is a really good film that leaves the viewer with a feeling of triumph and a life lesson that goes beyond prison walls."
608,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one the best movies i have ever watched, acting crew are amazing as well as everything in the movie but i don't think this movie should be the top rated movie of all time.the movie is truly an inspiring film where the based on true story makes it more amazing although the movie gets the watching people a little bit cold but all in all i can say its a nice movie. as i was reading trough the other reviews of this movie, i came crossed a review which said and i quote ""The best movies are ones that touch the souls"". i disagree, best movies should be rated according to many aspects but unfortunately the main contributing factor of rating movies nowadays is based on ""other peoples votes"". all in all, i have to say if you haven't watched the movie yet, you are not a movie person"
609,True,"This movie is really great, I enjoyed every minute of it. I want them to make a sequel to it. I want them to add more graphics get new actors and also try and get better locations.What I really like about this movie is that it really captures that feeling of reconnecting with people and how hard that can actually be. As I'm slowly closing in on 40 you see that you do not see the friends you hung out with as much anymore. You still talk to them and get along, but do not have the same connection anymore, simply because you do not share as much anymore as you are used to. Of course those relationships have been pushed to comedic proportions and are a great source for a lot of laughs. Simon Pegg steals the show as the boy trapped in a man's body and the story which initially starts out like a pub crawl soon turns into a pub brawl and an awesome one at that."
610,True,"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar."
611,True,"A true masterpiece of modern cinema , with Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction , a film that has left its mark in the past 10 years. Frank Darabont 's film , based on Stephen King material , captures in a way that could not be more memorable triumph of human spirit over a hostile destiny . Drama is built and crafted by the most thorough detail: fine-tuned scenario , congealed story that makes you cry for a happy end , which, although coming, though still not fully satisfy you (why many films have done that ? ) . Each element of the decor brings its contribution corresponding to the emotional tension of the film developed . ""The Shawshank Redemption"" does not offer a tremendous psychological challenge or any rational incentive contrary, his charm lies in the emotional force that surrounds you slowly, carefully graded and highly inspiring. Impressive great emotional impact , the film you just steal a special atmosphere , a slight reconciled melancholy that makes you actually feel your blood human . Drama protagonist move upon you and they end up pushing the contemplation of the greatness of the human being. But the film is balanced , never falls into a bathos , vulgar or boring . Cadence dose slowly and subtly flowing impressionism , and finally can conclude proud : over all wrongs , than all the sufferings , miseries rises above all human splendor . Great triumph of human values ​​: patience, friendship , perseverance , selflessness is portrayed as a human universal film without falling into the trap American ( few directors escapes this trap , see Ridley Scott , Gladiator or Mel Gibson - Braveheart ) . The picture is superb, the sets have a special importance , assembly includes interesting symmetry , direction is gorgeous , Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman remain a tandem famous all do their duty and drain your last tear ... but not in an insidious , commercial and regret , the film is not at all a hoax , a scam , but has a substance perfect emotional density , highlighting , in a grand exquisite essences of humanity ."
612,True,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
613,True,"In THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover, and sent to prison. It's 1949, and Andy doesn't have the stuff for prison life. Andy befriends ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his past as a banker to get a job in the prison library. But things unravel. In doing the books for the warden, he learns that the prison boss is taking bribes, and Andy is to launder them. A lovable former inmate hangs himself when he gets to the outside after decades behind bars and can't adjust. The inmate whom Andy helps get his GED is shot by the guards to keep him quiet about information that might prove Andy is innocent of the murders and set him free. Andy spends two months in solitary. After he gets out, he seems depressed and Red worries he'll kill himself. The next day, Andy isn't dead, but he isn't there, either. He's escaped. The rest is a perfect Stephen King happy ending, complete with ill will for the corrupt warden. Steven King's Best book to film of all time."
614,True,"Review #1 of ""My Top ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:""The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion."" I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing ""Kumbaya""? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher."
615,True,"I'll go ahead and speak plainly about events from the movie, not caring too much about spoiling or not. If you haven't seen the movie and do not want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this review.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie just because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was second place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it. Not to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a point of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still haven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed film in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding it. It's certainly 7/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys along with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just slides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life develops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises here and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that ""hope"" thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite ""get it"". The only thing this movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not always the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in 1994 people did not? Maybe it's an internet this right? Internet stuff, that serious business. This strange Leviathan that transforms unknown South-Korean pop singers in music sensations and record-holders for most watched movie on the planet. The internet, maybe someone watched it and thought it would be funny to invent a secret message, so deep, so unworldly, so incredible and anyone who could not ""see it"" was instantly deemed unworthy.That monster that drives everyone to think this average movie should be considered some kind of demigod due to its averageness. We see that because we're average, enlightened beings see greatness, colossal messages within that lifts the human spirit, cleanse our souls with its reach.The movie was good, and that's about it."
616,True,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle."
617,True,"This is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very effectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a double murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a struggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and benefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through helping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the prison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man who entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The saddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a high school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the warden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent. Following that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur further events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells Red in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall (hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico using a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering money for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating the hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office wall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and struggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation to join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who committed suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful storytelling and attention to detail. It's truly a masterpiece."

Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."
620,True,"Of course this outstanding movie doesn't need my opinion, But Utterly I felt obligated to review, so let's do this thing : -The story is amazing, The sequence of the events, The surprise at the ending, I loved it. -One of the greatest perks in movies is the moral of it, which -in this case- hope, I find it mentally rewarding,Of course with The subliminal messages of -keep trying- or -never give it a rest- . -The characters are great, Specially Morgan's role (I'm just a big fan) -Soundtrack is pretty good, Not excellent (I prefer Quentin Tarantino's Taste of music, So I'm not criticizing the soundtrack because it's fairly not my type) -And finally the best thing IMO about this movie was its simplicity in everything, yet It delivers . thanks for taking time reading my opinion :)"
621,True,"One Of the best movies I have seen The script was well written. The characters played there parts well & were well suited for there picked rolls.

622,True,"'Get busy livin' or get busy dyin', that's damn right'.A stand-out performance from the magnificent movie maestro Morgan Freeman, whom leads this spectacular motion picture with fantastic style as the enigmatic convict known as Red, earning himself a well deserved Academy Award nomination. Tim Robbins plays our main protagonist, Andy Dufresne, an innocent banker charged with the murder of his wife, a crime he did not commit. The film chronicles Dufresne's time in Shawshank Penetentiary, from the first day meeting the 'more-than welcome' guards, to dirty deals with corrupt Warden Sharp (played by a superb Bob Gunton), to befriending characters like Red and Brooks, a 70-something long-sentence server acting as librarian (played by James Whitmore, in one of his later roles) and to the momentous break-out, symbolising everything this film stands for: hope. Shawshank is the perfect movie, great story, great actors and a great director. The culmination of captivating music and scintillating atmosphere transform this movie into something more: a legend. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, it is a must watch."
623,True,"The movie starts bit slow, but right from the start you will feel that you are into it. Every moment your mind will be wondering what will happen next cos you never know. The director has made great effort to make it like that. There are very few good movies that defines ""Hope"". But non can challenge this one. The movie shows how good can happen even in the worst, and to never loss hope. Morgan Freeman is another master piece in this movie. Both his acting and narration touches our heart. There are some extreme scenes in the movie that shows the reality to what happens in a Prison. How people tend to behave during the initial period and how they transform it to a routine that is to be followed every single day. I am really great full that i saw this movie and found a crucial part to believe in. If you are looking for a good classical movie that has drama, suspense and a message than this will be the best movies you will ever watch. If you are looking for a action movie and hungry for blood then this is not for you."
624,True,"Paragraphically, at First, when I see the film, some Centinal stuffs wasn't pull out. Due to many problems and unresolved conflicts, I see it as a dump. But when I see it the second time, I understand what it is about, and how it came to be the greatest drama of all time. It benefits from a strong cast, feeling that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did the film themselves. They devoted to the film all they got. From expression, to heavy feelings. They look us in the eye, and expresses their demand for freedom and a life of a normal man. The film drives us from jail to out, resulting some hard to be fitted in like Brooks. It's an unique way, seeing the prisoners dealing with their life afterward, not like any other films. It has a great script, a set scene full of masterpiece coming to life after 20 years of finding it's own success. It stepped out, starting as a bomb, but ended as a real life and day with surviving and breakthrough hearted mean with the Shawshank Prison"
625,True,I absolutely loved this movie. It's very heart warming and is full of emotion. I loved it so much i even went to one of the prisons that the movie took place in. Mansfield Ohio Reformatory. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Morgan Freeman and puzzle solving films. It is also and inspirational film to look up on because of the story line and all the different angles and what not. If you ever want to go to the prison in Mansfield.. The scene where Mr. Brooks hangs himself in his apt and carves his name was also shot in that very prison. I also must say that this film brought me into tears of sadness and joy. The director was really good at capturing the emotions for the viewers.
626,True,"This movie is one of my favorites.First of all, scenes are so real in the mean time are dramatic enough. I especially liked the final scene and quotes about hope as movie lasts. While watching, I did not expect that the film will have happy ending so that one can think that escaping such kind of prison can never be possible. However in the end, this process became successful in a way that we can never imagine. From my point of view, with this point, aim of movie is to show that in every hard situation it is possible to succeed with just not losing hope and be optimistic about our dreams which does not let us to give up, conversely to draw conclusions even we can never imagine. This movie had really huge impact on this side."
627,True,"""Hope is a good thing and no good thing ever dies"". This one line of the film says it all, this movie is all about hope, and things which you can relate to in your life. I became a huge fan of Freeman after watching this movie. Movie is bit slow in starting but builds up pace quickly. You start flowing with Andy and have a connect with him as the movie progresses. The story goes like this- Andy is send for life time imprisonment for allegedly killing his wife and her boyfriend,in jail first few years were really bad but slowly he starts to find friend and also some work. If I tell more than the whole suspense will come out. The emotions carried out in each seen by red and Andy has been superb. Its a must watch!!"
628,True,"This is for sure my favourite pre-2000 movie. Its prison, its life, it has everything a guy could ask for and I didn't even name half of the stuff in this movie! You have Andy coming in for a crime he didn't even commit, Tommy who got caught robbing some place, you even got Brooks who kills himself because he couldn't handle being out of prison. I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I can see myself watching it tonight. My favourite part would have to be the ending when Red and Andy meet in Mexico after Andy escapes, which I might add was really cool too. How he dug a tunnel out and lead the guards off, that would take major skill if Hollywood magic didn't exist. Well, anyway, watch it. You will love it."
629,True,"The beginning of the film is remarkable, but when Andy finally gets out of solitary confinement and is sitting against the wall next to Red, you can feel the stress and the intensity of the movie. There is no other movie that I have ever seen where a silent intensity has ever been done so well. You as a member of the audience know that something is going on, and the storytelling by Morgan Freeman seals the deal. The acting in this film is remarkable, and the subplots and the heartfelt ending of the film truly make this film worthy of the number one spot on t list. The writers and casters of the film could not have selected a better actor for Andy's part than Tim Robbins, with his logical, calm, and reserved personality that reflected so well onto the film. Finally, the realization of the other inmates that Andy is in fact innocent is absolutely chilling, and has you rooting for the character all along. This film is number one on the top 250 for a reason."
630,True,"Life in ShawShank Prison coalesces criminality, corruption, death, truth, god and hope into a wonderful film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Set in the 1940's, Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life is altered forever when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Shawshank demonstrates how quickly and naively the criminal justice system can wrongly convict a man and alter his destiny forever. Lady justice clearly is incapable of knowing all things and rendering perfect judgment.An innocent man at heart, Andy, with the help of his friend Red, showcase the life of prisoners and put on full display internal prison dynamics, the effects of lengthy prison sentences on the soul, the process of rehabilitation, and the will to survive with hope to live and fight another day. Following his conviction, Andy is tortured by a small immoral gang of rapists until the warden places him in his protective womb. In exchange for his services and help with financial matters Andy's stature grows and his influence spreads. A friendly relationship develops over the years, with Andy eventually processing tax returns, and subsequently running a fraudulent scheme for the warden. Surprise twists find its way in the form of a truth telling inmate overhearing the real killer of Andy's wife. Warden Norton wants no part in this, fearing for his operations and control of the institution. Quickly he pours ice on the idea, and subjugates Andy to physical torment to bend his will.Ever the precocious young lad, Andy secretly plots for over 20 years and reveals an astounding and ingenious strike to send Warden Norton into a suicidal finale.Shawshank is a classic, darker than The Green Mile, yet truthfully a reflection of how the system can go so very wrong. Sometimes, truth and justice are not good enough, and one must rely on himself to adequately realign the scales."
631,True,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever watched. It has everything you can ever ask from a movie without being cheesy or over the top on any score.I love the way the story is told by the main character himself. You can really see the life of a prisoner in there and the struggle they all go through. They somehow manage to find things to make them enjoy the time and eventually get used to the idea of staying inside the prison. They all learn to become friends but still finds enemies, like the warden and some of the guards. They are portrayed as the good guys even though they are prisoners who has committed crimes. You really bond to them through the screen and can look through their eyes. The ending of this movie, the first time I saw it, was so unexpected! The way he had spent so many years to carve a hole in the wall and then escape. And then the very last scene when they meet each other again on the beach! 10 out of 10!"
632,True,"The first time I heard about The Shawshank Redemption was during the Oscars. They showed probably the worst scene they could (when Andy is playing the opera music to the prison.) Unfortunately, I never got to see Shawshank in the theaters. I saw it on VHS and instantly fell in love with the movie. The story made me want it to go on forever. I rented the movie five times before finally buying it on VHS. I cannot recommend this movie any higher. Since I saw it the first time in 1995, no movie has approached it. Frank Darabont directed a brilliant movie and made me a fan of his movies. For a story about two men in prison, it definitely surprised me. The story will keep you hoping to find the truth and sticking around to find out how it all will end. Hope you enjoy the show!"
633,True,"This film is on my list of all time favorites. It has an awesome message. This film has so much depth and growth that its like a great page turner that you don't want to put down.Director Frank Darabont was out did himself in this film. He gave the viewer just the right amount of every aspect of drama, excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. He gave such a detailed depiction of prison life in a way that has never been seen on screen but yet gave us a sense of compassion for prisoners as well.Tim Robbins gave a very phenomenal performance from start to finish. He was the guy you just always wanted to route for. His performance was great throughout the film . Robbins played Andy Dufresne who was convicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison. He has to learn to adapt to a whole new life. He be-friends an African American man named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Red is feels as if he has no hope of ever being anything more than an inmate and is content with that. Red feels that the only way to survive is to become still to the world and try not to become institutionalized. Throughout the years Red watches his friend Andy go through a lot of things and change. Along with their good friend Brooks Halten played by James Whitmore who gave an awesome performance as well. The three experience prison life together but in different ways. Over all the cinematography, the directing and the performances were EXCELLENT! If you've never seen this film it is a definite must see. You will love it and I bet it will be on your list of all time favorites as well. I give this film a excellent rating because it has all the makings of a great film and delivers just that. It was a GREAT FILM all around!"
634,True,"As English is not my native tongue, it is a bit hard to grasp what does 'Redemption' means in Shawshank's Redemption. In my understanding, a prisoned is helpless, who can he save?It is even more confusing that Shawshank is an innocent guy. Surely the word 'revenge' will be more appropriate to replace 'redemption' in this context. As the film unfold, it becomes clear to me that Shawshank redeemed himself and others as he wasn't hateful. He calmly accept the unfairness in his life and dealt it with dignity and resilience. Some time, we are caged in a prison that's created by ourself. We often cry out 'it is unfair!' or 'It is not just!' But how often do we actually take any actions against them? Do we have the confidence that one day the prison wall will eventually get through by a small tool? Can we calmly deal with the pressure and threat that consume us mentally and physically? Are we ready to craw through a gutter that's full of sh*t to reclaim our entitled freedom?When we in despair, it is encouraging to reflect on this fictional guy - Shawshank. Life some time is not about revenging, it is about redeeming. It is easier to revenge, but cooler to redeem."
635,True,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.Every scene of the movie was a masterpiece!The role of a prisoner matched perfectly with Morgan Freeman and hearing his voice through the movie made it the best movie to see in years.The last scene was my favorite and the most feeling one!Another scene that I liked was the moment that Morgan Freeman (Red) went under the tree next to the stones and found the little box with the money and the card-postal.I recommend you to watch this movie , it will be one of your favorites.I have watched a variety of movies but I can easily take this out of the many and tell you that the actors and the producer made a wonderful job and made one of the best movies ever."
636,True,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST OF ITS KIND that I remember. This movie had me thinking and trying to figure it out through most of the movie. Its surprising, humorous, sad, dis/encouraging, and all worth the wait. If you like a MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD MOVIE thats down to earth, then Definitely watch The Shawshank Redemption. It takes you through all emotions possible without being too harsh. This movie is great Alone and with Others EQUALLY. If you feel down, discouraged, or bored, then put this on IMMEDIATELY. The Shawshank Redemption is witty, unpredictable, informative, inspirational, Shocking but also A true depiction of past circumstances for the most part."
637,True,"The Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the time it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being without any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan picture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome incidents and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.)"
638,True,"It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (""End Titles"" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as ""fresh fish."" There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape"" references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, ""I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie"". Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying."
639,True,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
640,True,"The #1 rating on IMDb.com's top 250 is no mistake. It was one of those movies where you feel exhausted at the end. Morgan Freeman was mind- blowingly authentic in playing Red and was made for the part. The plot was well thought out, and the escape by Andy was surprising even as a viewer. And the last 20 minutes are the best of any movie I've ever seen. It didn't leave you in tears of sadness or happiness, just a fantastic sense of closure. The acting was terrific and a spectacular way to use 2+ hours. Highly recommended and in my Top 10, easily."
641,True,"What does this film, and why, in fact, I'm wondering in the first place this issue? Probably because the main idea of ​​what to look for and morality that the film brings to your mind, if it is of course possible - this is the most interesting. Moreover, you understood the book / film - is a kind of specific experience in the treasury of his own thoughts and knowledge.I read Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" Not surprisingly, the book, however, as always, the better the movie. But Frank Darabont took unmatched movie that could play King wrote in his book, and in this film is definitely a plus.So what, exactly, teaches ""The Shawshank Redemption""?Andy Dyufreyn for as much as twenty years, has lost none of its force of will, ruthlessly, albeit slowly, breaking free, with it in secret.Frantic zeal for freedom. Why would it not be worth it. He lost twenty years of his life, because his wife, along with her lover killed by another person. And is it fair?The warden continuously urged Andy to believe in the Bible. Called, until one glorious day it has not broke big check, and the place of its documents and reports that Andy was doing, he found that same Bible, and a note from Dyufreyna himself. Hopelessness, a setup? Not at all, my friends. Andy just gutted out the truth, bringing his tormentor took his own life.And here it is, the same will, the life! Twenty years, he has only seen her in a dream!The very desirable house on the ocean near the Mexican land, a loyal friend, a little later freed Andy Dyufreyna, a small boat and hamburgers from a roadside cafe. He could not. He did it.Freedom of the most expensive."
642,True,"I simply love this movie, it just connects to you. Makes you feel like you lived it yourself! With a reason on top of the list. Just a hearth warming story that gives you chills at moments. An really epic movie. If you want the full experience read the book also. Steven King is a master and a true artist! Just few movie remakes of the book are really good and this is one of them. An experience that can't be matched with with just watching the movie or reading just the book. The combination of dose two is one of the greatest things that you can do for the seventh art! I hope you enjoy my review and the movie. And i need to writhe a filler line because i miss 1 line of text so i can post this review."
643,True,"An amazing movie about human nature & real friendship. Hope can be found in the darkest of times. I completely agree that this is the leader of the list.Good camera quality, good work of the actors involved. It is delight to watch the interaction between the actors adding to the magic of the costumes and surroundings. Every frame takes you into the world and story without deviating from the red thread of the story arc.To some the movie might be a bit too long. The plot leaves you with a good and genuine feeling of having watched one of Hollywood's best & brightest at work."
644,True,"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contraries, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling formlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it ""a poster child for Christianity"". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic)."
645,True,"The shawshank redemption was probably the best film I've ever watched. Somehow it feels like Forrest Gump. The main character, Andy trying to keep he life style despite the fact that he was in prison which is a place of no freedom, no friends.What impressed me is that Andy made Red to get a poster of Rita Hayworth and he stick it to the wall of his cell. We have been told repeatedly in most prison movie that a con should has no privacy and personal belonging, that the jailer will keep destroying everything you have and make you suffer. But Andy somehow managed to keep the sexy poster on his wall, made chess out of own time, that is impressive.To be honest, I was shocked because like everyone else I have been living a life as a slave to the work->eat->sleep->work cycle and just don't have the gut to take the leap of faith into what is waiting beyond.I believe like Andy's dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean, which he made it come true, everyone has a dream of his own and we should try our best to accomplish them."
646,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is an impressive story that focuses on two themes. The main theme is a heart-warming story of perseverance and redemption. The sub-theme is more akin to an exposé of the penal system and the horrors that it creates. These two themes intermingle throughout the entire film until it ends with an anti-climactic revelation that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has not only beaten the system, personified in Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), but has also managed to save another inmate, 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), from death. The director and producer work together in an impressive combination of screenplay, lighting, sound and editing. I won't spend too much time on the screenplay, simply because I cannot do it justice. However, the writing and acting were impressive to say the least. The actors mingled in a way that very effectively reinforced the two themes stated above. During their time at Shawshank the actors progressively lose their vitality and morality. As the movie progresses all the characters show the oppressive effects of the penal system, both when it is used as designed as well as when it is abused by the Warden. Andy is no exception to this rule. I feel that the film is designed to show us that Andy would be destroyed by Shawshank as well, if he hadn't found the means to be free of it. Lighting and color were another medium that the director took advantage of to portray the misery and glory of Andy's story at Shawshank. The Shawshank Redemption was filmed with a strong preference for harsh lighting. Very rarely in the film is anyone portrayed graciously, even our main character is exemplified for his flaws. The color choices were even more indicative of the harsh realities of Shawshank prison. The prison is practically gray-washed, and would have been almost as effective if it were filmed in black-and-white. This strongly supported the sub-theme that speaks against the penal system. However, when Andy makes the choice to do something with what little freedom he has, there is a significant change in the color of the film. This is most notable in the opening and expansion of the library. During these scenes the lighting and color of the film seems to brighten considerably, showing the viewer that Andy's perseverance of attitude and self-improvement have a distinct effect on the nature of even Shawshank's oppressive walls. The sound and narration of the film also relate well to the film. The sound effects in the film are universally harsh lending weight to the oppressive atmosphere. The stark grinding of metal bars on stone, or the shuffling of inmates feet are sounds that are good examples of this. The narration serves a dual nature. It is almost necessary just to speed the progress of the film that covers a number of years of imprisonment. However, it also teaches us a lot about the history of Shawshank. The narrator's voice is old and seems weighed down with Red's own battle at Shawshank. However, it also holds a measure of Hope, a feeling that seems foreign to the gray walls of the prison. This duality of emotion exemplifies the nature of the war between the two themes of Hope and Oppression."
647,True,"The other day I saw Shwashank Redemption (yeah yeah, I had to be clobbered to watch it, more fool me). What an intense movie! Yes it is an epic movie, yes its beautifully narrated, but what struck me most was this movie reminded me of Joseph, son of Jacob in the bible.I mean look at the similarities- Joseph the favorite of Jacob, apple of his fathers eye. Joseph who dreamed about ruling over his brothers. And here we have Andy, the blue eyed genius of the banking sector, who has it all, money, position and a beautiful wife.Joseph is cheated by his brothers and sold into slavery. He is then tempted by his boss's wife, and he resists the temptation in good faith. But anyway he is falsely implicated and sent to prison. Andy gets cheated by his wife and best friend, in a fit of drunken rage Andy entertains the idea of harming then, but quickly sobers up and resists the temptation. Andy also gets falsely implicated.So now we have two innocent men in prison, but both don't let circumstances deter them. Both use their talents where they were placed and grow and rise to new heights. Joseph found favor with the warden and became in charge of the prisoners. Andy started filing tax returns for all of the prison guards and was made the library in charge.Joseph is freed from prison because of his ability to interpret dreams. Joseph is made the governor of the land and becomes very prosperous. Andy's banking skills allow him the leeway to manage his escape from prison. Andy comes across great wealth that he was managing for the warden.And finally Joseph gets reunited to his family, while Andy gets reunited with Red who was his friend from the prison.Amazing coincidence, ain't it?"
648,True,"Well, not only that but perhaps the greatest film of all time as well.Tim Robbins and more-so Morgan Freeman give their best performances ever.It is perhaps a crime this did not win best picture but at least it was nominated and I cant really get to mad as Forrest Gump is a top 10 movie ever.This is 3 hours but it just flies by.The characterization is perfect.One of the most unique dynamics of the film is we all root on Andy Dufresne (Robbins) without knowing for sure if he is actually the murderer or not.We also feel compassion and empathy for Red (Morgan Freeman) even though HE DID commit murder.You get to like these characters a great deal learning about their personality inside the Shawshank Prison.The Wardon and the guards abuse their power making Andys escape one of the most feel good endings of all time.You cant help but smile.A movie everyone should see, numerous times and have in their collection.Get busy living..or get busy dying..."
649,True,"A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or you get busy dying'. They are like music to ears."
650,True,"*Contain Spoilers*The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Director - Frank Darabont Cinematographer  Roger Deakins Writers  Stephen King and Frank Darabont Editor  Richard Francis-BruceFavorite Quote: ""Hope is a good thing and good things never die."" The Shawshank Redemption is about time, patience, hope and loyalty. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (protagonist) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, picks him as the new recruit. The first part of the film deals with Andy, Red and their group of friends dealing with prison life.Andy wants to be a freeman. He regrets his past and wants to move on with a new life and memories. But the ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy. A corrupt warden, sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack. He has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.After almost a two decade stay, in 1966, Andy Dufresne escapes the Shawshank prison by tunneling through the wall with a rock hammer worn down to the nub. He sets off to a new country for a new life and is later accompanied by his prison mate Red.Andy Duresne is a man of hope. He is a smart person and a loyal friend. The Shawshank Redemption is the journey of redemption of Andy and his fellow convicts. Redemption is found in many ways, by many characters, even by a bird named Jake. It's a story portraying the corruption and politics in a prison and the transformation of an investment banker to a smart con. It shows how the weak and innocent protagonist, who is often bullied and tortured during his early stay in prison, adapts and changes himself with the situation and out smarts the guards and warden to run away with their illegal money and starts a new life.Review By  Mayank Bhattacharya"
651,True,"Anyone who has not watched this movie needs to. Morgan Freeman's role really defined my generation. His performance as ""Red"" was probably the best I've ever seen.I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan, in fact this role is the only one I like, maybe Bull Durham...but not on this level. Andy Dufrane, really makes the best of what would simply drive most of us to the brink of insanity. He did it because he found friends. Which did become his family.Andy was a difficult man to know, he was so smart so intelligent. Even Red his friend who was telling the story didn't really seem to understand him, at least until the end. I love it how Andy had to put himself into positions to make the prison is own. He got himself out of a bad situation by befriending his enemies, and then when the time was right, taking them out. While in their minds they were using Andy for their benefits, but Andy knew he used them...brilliant.These two friends in a sense had their own lives defined by their friendship. How many people can say that have ever had a friend like that? I hope that in the next 20 years my best friend, will have help define me.The best thing about this movie, is how simple they made it. ""Get Busy Livin' or get busy dyin."" That in and of itself is advice we all need, especially when work or school seems to dictate our routines.My advice watch this movie. It is the best of the last 50 years. Period."
652,True,"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, James Whitmore and Clancy Brown star in this 1994 drama based on Stephen King's short story, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" This tells of mild-mannered Banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) who is framed for murdering his wife and her lover. He's sent to New England prison, Shawshank where he befriends convicted murderer, Ellis Redding aka ""Red"" (Freeman). Andy also puts up with corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Gunton) and his Guard Captain, Byron Hadley (Brown). Andy doesn't let them or the prison get the best of him because he has hope keeping him going. Sadler (Die Hard 2) plays prison inmate, Haywood who is friends with Red and Andy and the late, Whitmore (Psycho) plays their other friend, Brooks. I love this film, Robbins and Freeman are terrific in it and together, the rest of the cast is good as well and Thomas Newman's score is excellent. This is the film that always gives us hope and I highly recommend it."
653,True,"I will start with a basic summary:This movie starts out with a banker(Tim Robbins) who supposedly killed his wife and her lover while drunk. This led to a conviction and prison sentence. Most of the story takes place in this prison, Shawshank. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the main characters, who become best friends who use their friendship as a means to escape from the hell of prison and the devil in their warden. Tim (Andy), a brilliant man, manages to make a slightly better prison life for himself and his fellow inmates by helping out the warden with basic office things. However, this was not enough for him. He need to escape, and escape he did in the most spectacular way. Now, I will give my opinion on the film:This film is something that you should devote time to watching when you have no interruptions. Turn off your cellphone and unplug your home phone before watching it because the greatness of this film is something that shouldn't be interrupted. The story line is perfect. The acting is perfect. The characters are so deep and gripping. The setting is excellent. If you have money, I would definitely recommend that you buy this in blu-ray (if you have blu-ray player) and connect it to a surround sound system, because you will want to hear every spoken word, every fallen leaf, every gust of wind, every detail.This is one of about only 5 movies that I give a solid 10 stars."
654,True,"Yes. No need to watch this movie, instead just play it on DVD, close your eyes and just listen to Morgan Freeman's narration of a prison Life, Hope, Friendship and the days in Shawshank. Every important move in this movie is described by Morgan and his voice is such a plus that it lift the movie to next level.In a scene, where the entrance of the prison tower was shown in the top angle, it shows the world in to which the prisoners are entering. It is a sample scene where the director relied on cameraman to convey the message instead of 10 line dialog.Everyone expects Morgan and Tim to become friends after all both of them are big actors. It is predictable. But the way the friendship develops is truly amazing screenplay.Many sub-plots, people with different attitude were shown in the movie. Not all of them are good people. But most of the characters are in transformation phase where they repent for their mistakes.Poetic scene ? Many scenes are there. But the one in which Morgan, Tim and others drink beer at the top of the roof of one of the building and the way Morgan narrates the scene.. Amazing...It contains a twist which is a ingredient for any thriller movie. Yet that brilliant scene is so subtle that everyone appreciate.Will there be any other movie in our life time where it can be simple yet be so powerful and heart touching ?. Doubt we will see such a movie soon.As many said before, don't rent it.. instead buy this movie and keep it safe for next generation to see this movie..Hats off to Morgan, Tim and everyone who acted in this master piece..."
655,True,"Two thousand four hundred and five IMDb users have bothered to write a review of this movie. I read all of them and did not find a bad one. Of course I didn't! I had not seen the movie and that is true. Every single one of my friends and acquaintances has, and not surprisingly, recommended it with the highest of praise. The fact that I had not did put into question my claim to be a movie lover. Now that I have, I admit it serves me right to have been questioned so.It is a damn good movie for all the reasons everyone wrote in their reviews and why critics also raved about it. I have no excuse for not watching it before other than my prejudice toward any movie having to do with jails, the prison life etc..Halfway into the movie, I was not convinced my prejudice about movies dealing in any way with prison would change, but the acting was good enough to keep me going. I was very happy with the direction this movie took, especially with the ending. Not since ""The Birdman from Alcatraz"" and Escape from Alcatraz have I enjoyed a movie that has prison as the setting; I don't expect it will soon either since my phobia with that is not going away soon. Finally, having seen Shawshank, I can now have an intelligent conversation about movies with friends and acquaintances without risking admonition for my failing to see the movie. Anybody that hasn't seen it yet and claims some knowledge of movies deserves, as I did, to be castigated. I've made my peace with the matter and I'm moving on."
656,True,"A complete experience out of the box filled with the class of the Golden and Silver Age of Hollywood. Its music leaves one as entranced as at the end of an epic and its story line strikes one as odd as does the sight of originality in a commercial world. It makes sense that Shawshank did poorly at the box office in its initial run because its commercial appeal is perhaps not as much as was that of Forrest Gump or Lion King. But its brilliance outweighs both of those films and instantly grabs one and reels one in. Soothing narration by the Sidney Poitier of the late 20th century and the all around nice guy persona projected by Tim Robbins makes the film a high achiever any where and any time. Why this film wasn't sent in to Cannes escapes me. The best part about the film is that even after one has watched it and knows the complete story, it seems as if the entire story does not necessarily depend upon the ending or the climax, every scene stands out on its own. The pacing of the film was what struck me as particularly surprising. I never once felt that a scene had been accelerated or had been overly edited. The hand carved chess pieces, the acts of altruism, the escape and most of all, Marilyn Monroe elevate this film to anyone's BEST EVER list. I won't say its a classic yet though because it hasn't even been twenty years since it was released."
657,True,"so much beauty in the friendship we see in this film, greatest film I've ever seen. when this film was up for the best picture oscat, im glad it was, the Oscar goes to, and not the winner is, because that year the was no winner. just such beauty in every film up, not to this date have a never seen a line up like that for best picture and the best actor. tom hanks, no doubt played the best role of he's life but morgan freeman played a role of the century. tim robbins was outstanding in fact the whole cast were terrific.if this film is the last film im ever gonna see then let it be it, because I've watched something worth dreaming forever about."
658,True,"Wow!!! And just in case I haven't made my self clear enough, WOW!!!! There are movies you kinda enjoy, good ones and even the occasional welcome surprise. And then, seldom, you come across a movie like this one. The kind where the end titles have already gotten to the soundtrack part, but you still haven't budged not believing what just hit you. This is a story which will take you on a truly beautiful journey, through all possible emotions, always under the steady guidance of Morgan Freeman's unequaled narrative. Tim Robbins is simply brilliant, making the evolution from docile, even fragile, inmate to jailbreak mastermind a riveting experience. All in all, I have always found it surprising, given the bleak prison life dominating the film's story, how this movie is foremost a tale of perseverance, true friendship and hope."
659,True,"This wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen before this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each other. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the slightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison movies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end. That's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers, psychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more or less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be thankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not because it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a man falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep to make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to have made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and he's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this character greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more than you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based off a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well directed, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see how some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd be more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are better films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250. So I give it a final score 8/10, I think I'm being fair when I say that."
660,True,"My gosh, where to begin with this movie.....practically everything was nailed, spot-on. The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as one will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy Dufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true -- after all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy grows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of the movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim Robbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins' lesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was considered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil Andy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet pensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent thinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The Shawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from Andy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's respect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie teaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in prison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls -- it all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart. I also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very gradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends that one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes time to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and contributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us how much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported notion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank Redemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited access to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in most other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in this one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable ""rehabilitated"" speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves: does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the ""easiest"" he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red ""get busy living, or get busy dying"" and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made."
661,True,"Call me a wet blanket, by I won't join the chorus calling SR the greatest movie ever. Entertaining, yes. Thrilling at times, also. But in both regards I actually had more fun watching The Sting, or Capricorn One for that matter. Great cinematography though, specially during some incredible shots, that of the whole jail population standing still, frozen in their places, hearing the two sopranos sing Mozart and the one of Andy standing in the rain, raising both arms to the skies, expressing the joy of being a free man again.The acting is excellent across the board, except for the kid, who labors too much to be likable. The atmosphere of the prison is suitably conveyed in the claustrophobic settings, from the hopelessly enclosed, barren, courtyard inside the high walls to the always menacing presence of the uniformed guards. Here those hovering presences are not mere decorations, part of the landscape, as in many prison movies, but true components of the brutal reality of the world behind bars. The mortal beating received by one of the newcomers, the first night, warns us that these guards are an active part of the plot, so we have to take them seriously, get used to see them as such.This is a superbly done production from any point of view. The pace is thoroughly sustained, its overall forward flow allowing for scenes of unmitigated violence fit the unfolding story as effortlessly as others more settled ones, without modifying the momentum, because there's always something, someone, anchoring them all to the essential thrust of the film; the best ex.: the contemplative faces of the convicts, seen in semi darkness, while Hadley beats the newcomer to death, which tells us this kind of incident is just part of their everyday lives, almost a routine occurrence.What makes SR lose points in my book is the unlikely in some crucial plot elements as the unrealistic in some scenes, developments, especially after Andy has escaped. The biggest plot hole of all, IMHO, is the fact that warden Norton should have ever trusted the management of his scam to a convicted criminal under his careand a double murderer at that, as Andy was for him anyway. Call me naive, but I don't think there's one single warden in the world dumb enough to do such a thing when he may have easy access to many experts in the outside--financial consultants, bankerswho would give him help, advice, as useful, or even better, as the one provided by a convict who could easily turn into a blackmailer. And what best proves this point is precisely what Andy says to Red when explaining how he organized the fraud--the false identity of Randall Stevens, the multiple bank accounts--when he gloats that ""It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail"". As Norton had to know at least as much about these matters, how could he have trusted in a man who not only had the ability to take the whole thing away from him, as the experienced banker he was, but who could also send someone by mail the story of the scam, as an insurance policy, in case things would get dangerous for him in the can? Norton had to know from the beginning he was engaging in a loser's game. If he eliminated Andy he risked losing forever contact with his hidden funds; and if he didn't, he'd be forever vulnerable to his blackmail. So it isn't surprising why Andy's so happy about the whole thing. The question is, how could have Norton been so stupid to think he had any control on the situation? Other plot holes concern Andy's escape. See, he crawls hundreds of yards inside a 2--feet sewage pipe and then everything--the stink of human waste above all--goes away as by charm, with a simple rainfall. He smells like roses again. And just hours later he's perfectly groomed, dressed, ready to visit every bank manager in surrounding towns to make the necessary withdraws. He doesn't even look tired, when he surely must haven't taken a wink in the last 24 hours, busy as he was trying to get away from the jail house. And how did he manage to reach the Mexican frontier safe and unmolested? didn't the authorities publish his mug shot in every newspaper, tacked it to the wall on every police station, bus stop, within a few hours of his evasion? That part of his odyssey seems to have occurred as by miracle or divine protection. Now, if I'm nagging about all these things is simply because this is drama--so I'm led to think from the beginningand drama is the genre towards which we are the least forgiving concerning the unrealistic or the unlikely. (In thrillers like Capricorn One or The Sting we close our eyes to the same things, as we understand the main purpose there is to thrill us).Other of the weakest elements in SR lies in some of its characters. I have nothing to say about Andy or Red--as Freeman plays here again his Ted to Eastwood's Munny anyway. Neither about Hadley which if he seems a bit exaggerated in his wickedness doesn't seem unrealistic for someone who has read Abbott's In the Belly of the Beast. But minor characters are obviously used for emotional manipulation, specially the rocker kid. About him, after Red's voice over says that ""everyone liked him""--what else we could do? (Anyway this character was put there just to show us viewers that Andy was innocent after all, so he was safely disposed of after that. Curious thing, I was comfortable with the idea of leaving that kind of foggy. Uhh, you can take people out of the Code but...). And the same for the situation with the Sisters, which is left to degenerate, when all what Hadley had to do was to tell them to leave Andy alone.But above all, great narrative, great plot development. 9/10."
662,True,"Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its one of those movies where you just sit and reflect for a while after the final credits roll. Great plot, script, and acting. One of the best ever made. When Andy escaped at the end and screwed the warden over, my gosh, it does not get any better than that. It also has one of those twists in it where you think that one thing is going to happen and the completely opposite does. Near the end, when everyone thought that Andy was going to commit suicide and we all thought that he was going to be in the cell dead, he was gone, vanished. When the warden revealed the whole in the wall hidden by the poster I don't remember felling better for the outcome of a movie than I did at the end of this film."
663,True,"Shawshank Redemtion is the best film I've ever seen, I personally think that they should make so many more unforgettable films like this elsewhere in the world. Overall this inspirational motion picture is definitely out of this world. In my opinion this Movie is thought-provoking and it touches your sole in many ways.Andy Dufresne who was unlawfully sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, became great friends with 'Red' a convict who was an influential inmate inside the Shawshank prison, they became a surprising partnership inside Shawshank prison Night after night, day after day, Andy tried to adapt to prison life, however he realised he shouldn't be in this indescribable road to hell so thats where his plans begin...."
664,True,"hi i'm 14 years old and this movie is my favourite film of all time. everything about it is stunning, the set, the characters, the acting, the story, the directing, the writing, the music - everything was fantastic and complemented the point of the film.everyttime i watch it, i seem to feel cleansed and happy. a whole lot of people would just say that it is a depressing and boring movie, but when you watch it and understand the plot and watch it through to the end the ""redemption"" makes you feel ""redeemed"".while i probably enjoy a casual simple movie (whether comedy or action etc...) on a rainy day this movie is definitely my favourite. i strongly recommend this to anyone looking for an inspirational (although i'll admit it is a bit weird to be inspired by convicted felons) movie with clever twists and ingenuity. a 10/10 for me"
665,True,"This is now the 2,340th Review of this Title. However, I'm still writing it because this movie deserves to be written about. It really exceeds the 10/10 scale. An awe-inspiring story of hope, this is just one of those movies that you know you still want to watch in 20 years. The movie premise itself at first sight doesn't seem like it will be all that interesting. However, from the first minutes, you realize the superior writing, acting and cinematography unrivaled I would say by any other film I've seen. Throughout the movie, I find myself constantly connected to the characters, wishing that the warden would overcome his cold-hearted nature and concede to let our antagonist, Andy free from the torment that was The Shawshank Prison. I almost let out an audible sob when Tommy was shot. If you're looking for something to bring you up, to give you hope, you've come to the right place. This movie is probably the most soul-touching piece of two and half hour film out there, encompassing friendship, suffering, hope, and freedom. This movie is really what I believe that this should serve as the model for Hollywood. It's about time that they learn that for a movie to be good, it doesn't need excessive gore, or explosions on screen, or special effects, or sex scenes or any of what comes with the modern-day Hollywood production. This movie is pretty simple. Just men talking. If you haven't seen this movie yet, now the #1 movie on the IMDb leader boards, you don't know what you're missing. A must see for anybody and everybody of age. (10/10)"
666,True,"Can a man find redemption if he truly repents for the crimes he'd committed? Can the human spirit triumph even in the darkest of places, like a prison? Is hope a dangerous thing? These are the questions you will be asking yourself after watching this Fillet Mignon of a film masterpiece. Based on the incredible writer Stephen King and directed by the diamond in the rough film director Frank Darabont, the Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion. It's one of those movies that whenever it is on TV, I can't help but watch it from start to finish.The story is narrated by the soothing voice of Morgan Freeman, named Red. And he tells us of the time a new prisoner, Andy a former bank executive convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, came to the Shawshank Pennitentary. At first, Andy has a tough time adjusting to prison life, even getting beaten up a few times by the fellow thugs. But soon he finds his place doing the taxes of all the guards and the warden.There are so many good things about this film, I can barely think of all of them. The story in which it was based was indeed an enthralling one, Frank Darabont directed it and did a great job, not to mention the grade-A casting.I'm not sure what the main theme of this movie is, but if I had to guess, it would be about hope. And that hope cannot escape anyone, even those in positions where they feel like there is none. And that redemption is available for any man.I rate this movie a 10. I never considered giving it anything less."
667,True,"I've watched a number of movies during the years. I'm not sure whether that number is north of 500 but it's definitely close. No other movie has had the effect that Shawshank Redemption has on me every time I watch it.The movie describes the years in prison of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), a banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife. There he meets Red(Morgan Freeman), another convicted felon, who -like most movies featuring Morgan Freeman- is also the narrator of the movie.Throughout his years in prison, we watch Andy go from some prisoners' boxing bag, to prison's librarian, to prison guards' personal banker. We experience with him the pain, the frustration, the sorrow. Tim Robbins gives a magnificent performance opposite Morgan Freeman's Red, maybe the only role outshining Mandela in Invictus. I won't bother you with technical details about direction, cinematography and art direction. The All-Time Best Movie place here in IMDb is by it's own a testament of the excellence that is the Shawshank Redemption. Few (if any) movies will provide the viewer with such a feeling of catharsis by the end. I hope I haven't spoiled it. If you haven't already watched this masterpiece of a movie, rush to the nearest DVD store. Every human being able of watching a movie should watch this movie at least once.Cheers"
668,True,"From the intro setting up the mood for the 1940s with If I didn't Care that strangely feels like Bioshock or Fallout from the other era defining themes such as the relevance of Rita Haywood from the 50s to Tommy Williams emulating the James Dean Rock' n Roll character to set the mood of the 60s. This is something that has not been addressed when reviewing this movie, how it seamlessly transfer from era to era is genius in itself. The camaraderie between Andy and Red is flawless and the viewer truly believes that these two are the leaders of Shawshank and are the best of friends. By leaders, just look at the scene where Heywood is about to be slit by Brooks and Andy and Red are notified right away to solve the problem; great scene symbolizing their importance to the group. The only flaw which keeps it from being a perfect 10 out 10 movie is that it suffers from the same stereotype that prison movies are littered with, and that is the inclusion of sodomites. I know that's what happens in prisons, but is just disgusting and cringe worthy seeing this on screen; however Shawshank Redemption implies what the Sisters do to Andy and never graphically show it on screen and that is the saving grace. That is why it only loses one point and not several, anyhow. The movie's message about hope is more heavily implied near the end though, how Andy never loses hope while Red is closer to being institutionalized. The line get busy living or get busy dying always sends chills down my spine because of its relevance when Andy says it when he knows that the system is absolutely corrupt when his only witness that could get him a new trial is killed so that Andy could keep laundering money for the warden."
669,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a wise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some reflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my favorite movies? No, just a good watch."
670,True,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The only movie that can compete with this, in my opinion, is Forrest Gump. This movie is absolutely fantastic. If you have not seen this movie, stop reading now, and watch it. It has some of the best plot twists of any movie I ever saw (spoilers), the biggest one perhaps being when they really make it seem like Andy killed himself, but then it is revealed that he escaped. That was the biggest ""whoa"" moment for me and it continued by showing exactly how almost everything he had done over the past 19 years was a part of his elaborate escape plan. I can guarantee this will be one of your favorites as soon as you finish watching it, that's what happened for me. I love this movie, and I could watch it again and again. This movie definitely deserves to be number one on IMDb, and I have no idea why it isn't as highly praised by the critics as it is by normal people. But that seems to happen a lot, doesn't it?"
671,True,"Morgan Freeman is fantastic in this film as he guides Tim Robbins through his 20+ years at Shawshank Prison. This movie takes you through many different emotions. Everything that takes place in the prison makes me definitely not want to ever go to prison! Tim Robbins gives a superb performance as Andy Dufrense an innocent man sent to a very vengeful prison. If you have never seen this film, you will be amazed by everything that happens. Great ending by the way.The warden played by Bob Gunton is the perfect 2-faced bible-toting, under the counter dealing bad-guy in a position of power over others. Somehow this movie summed up life over the last fifty or so years looking back on who was in power running the country and big business."
672,True,"""You know the funny thing is, outside, I was an honest man. I had to get into prison to become a crook"" It is lines like this, that can effortlessly just make me shut my mouth, and marvel at this work of art. Morgan Freeman plays by far the most under-appreciated supporting roles in film history, and deserved the Oscar in my opinion (just watch the fifteen minutes after his prison sentence, particularly in the end, at Buxton, (I am being very subtle so I don't spoil anything!) and you will know what I am talking about). Take nothing away from Tim Robbins; sometimes, that one acting performance defines a legend. And honestly, if you are reading this review without having watched the movie yet, ...well, Go get it!! As far as rating goes, I would say ""Let all other ratings be relative to Shawshank""!"
673,True,"This is, by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's simply moving. Incredbly perfect in all the aspects. The story is unbelievable, with great actors and a director who really knew how to make the story work.Andy Dufresne really got the bad luck when he was incriminated for the murder of his wife and her lover. He had all the clues against him, and not a really convincing alibi. He made some friends in the prison, including his best friend, the guy who could get things(""Red""), and the director of the prison. Using his experience as a former banker, he helped the director of the prison to make lots of money corruptly.He helped the director in exchange for some favors. But the director didn't helped him when he most needed him, and, to make it worse, he killed the only witness who knew the guy that had really killed Andy's wife and her lover.What anybody expected is the end of this story, which I wont give away. I can only say that the hope Andy had for things to work out had materialized, and the good guys lived happy forever.Masterpiece."
674,True,"OH MY GOD!!! Such an amazing film! It's nice to know that Stephen King can do more than stories about Evil Spirits killing things. This film is perhaps on of the greatest films ever made! It is a movie about truth, justice, bravery, and prison rape (what more can one ask for!) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a perfect match for this film, and despite one or two moments of slow tension between Robbins and everyone else in the film, it is very deep, powerful,thought provoking, jaw dropping, eyes widening, and spine chilling from beginning to end. The only thing I don't understand is ""WHERE ARE THE WOMEN!?"" This film is 99.9999999...9999% men and only 0.0000000...0001% women (at the very beginning having sex) but that is seriously the only complaint one can make about this film, other than the fact that it is long and depressing. The ending is down right perfect, and I had found myself in awe when I saw Andy (Tim Robbins) crawl through a 500 yard sewage pipe only to come out the other side a free man. What makes me curious about the film is why haven't people noticed that he was carving a hole behind the posters? He had changed them occasionally, there must have been some time when someone walked by and noticed a hole in the wall. The film's realism sucks you in like a vacuum cleaner to the point where you feel like you are a prisoner in Shawshank just chilling with Freeman and the gang of prisoner who bet on which prisoner is gonna cry first."
675,True,"When I was seen the movie at the first time, I didn't really get the message of the movie. It's was so slow, but it didn't put me to sleep. I didn't know how the whole story would go to an end. I still able to enjoy it. I made myself to see it again, and finally I understood why it had so hight rate on IMDb. The movie started with Andy. A bank director, whom was sued for killed his wife and a man. Police fought exhibit to charge him for committed a murder. Andy was sent to jail for lifetime. In prison Andy met Red and they learned each other and became friendly. Red was a black man. He had been in prison almost 20 years at the time Andy came.Inside Andy always wanted to free himself out of the prison. It wasn't him, whom committed that horrible murder. I fell sorry for Andy. He paid his life for someone else, but nobody believed, he was innocently. What I was so surprised, Andy on the first time at the prison had planned to get out. Hope always inside him. That gave him strong to keep his plan to 20 years. And finally he was out of the prison.Red was different. He admitted, he was a murder when he was young. He apologised for what he did and wished to be a free man just like a bird. But every time he had a conversation with the whole manager, he always got denied. It's made him to feel hopeless. At the last time Red almost gave up all the hope. He didn't want to waste his time anymore. His speech was so amazing, fully emotion. Red just wished to go back at the time when he committed a horrible crime. He wanted to tell the kid, that what he did was so wrong. But he coundn't, he didn't have a miracle to do so. This time he got approved.What I learned about this movie was Hope and Friendship. Like Andy said ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of thing, and no good thing ever died"". He right, if we gave up hope, would we have a future?"
676,True,"The Shawshank Redemption begins with the hero of this story, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) being convicted of murder, and sent to Shawshank prison. While there Andy meets a man who is a very longtime convict, named Red (Morgan Freeman). With the help of his new friend, Andy will change Shawshank prison in a way that no one will see coming.I was absolutely shocked when I first saw this movie. At first I had no idea what to even say about it I thought it was so good. The Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion not only one of my favorite films of all time, but one of the greatest of all time. Tim Robbins delivers one of the best performances of his career, and was probably deserving of an Oscar nomination, along with Morgan Freeman who had an amazingly powerful performance as well. Overall The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, movies of all time. It is what I believe to be Frank Darabont's masterpiece."
677,True,"I want to start out by letting everyone know: I read Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption first, this may change the views I have towards the film (though not by much, but we'll get to that later).Shawshank Redemption is by far the best emotional roller-coaster that I've ever been on. I laughed some, I cried some, and I felt a genuine love for the characters and their struggle. In some ways, I want to say this is the greatest film ever but then I think about it, it's not the greatest film. There is a lot about it that makes it fantastic, some elements have the potential to be ""The greatest"". Here's the thing though: it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, I just can't find anything that I dislike about it. This may not make a whole lot of sense, but think of it this way: for a very long time my favorite movie was Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp was so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say ""That was the greatest movie I've ever seen."" Immediately my friend disagreed with me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this same friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I didn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I also told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me after that was: ""You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on IMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer people who are going to hate it."" He was absolutely right, there's just nothing to complain about.Now to the cast: Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was a great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for real, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not too acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made Andy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that Dufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the nonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman. The rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who plays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is one of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the effects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a theory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think so, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the plot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect: not too fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to Darabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked Stephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's fantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this one up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to dislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still followable) or if you like to think about every detail. I highly recommend it."
678,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about two best friends finding hope in their condemned lives. Andy is a banker who was wrongly convicted of killing his wife. His wife was cheating on him and murdered during her affair. Andy befriends Red a fellow inmate. During their time in prison together they become best of friends. They work through their hardships together. Throughout their story this group of inmates lives an unordinary prison life. This is shown from drinking beer while tarring the roof to doing the officers taxes. This is a remarkable story of the ups and downs of prison life and the new people they become. Andy states that in his free life he was a law abiding man, but he had to come to jail to become a criminal. This is commented on when he begins laundering money for the warden. Towards the end the camera shows Andy slumped on the ground leaning up against the prison, which is very neat. This view is from far away up above and gives the feeling of Andy being rather small. This is an amazing angle as it helps show how he is confused about escaping because he will miss his friends. The lighting throughout this movie allows us to see everything appropriately, but helps to set the mood of each scene. This can be seen when Andy is in the movie room about to be attacked the lighting is very dark. This is just one example of the many great lighting choices. This has been my favorite movie for a long time. This movie allows the viewer to look into the men's hearts and minds. Perhaps one of the classic themes to this movie is the narration throughout the movie that is performed by Morgan Freeman. I believe it is clear how great this movie is as it is ranked #1 on IMDb for all time movies. This movie will always be one of the greats, and will withstand the test of time."
679,True,I recently saw this film at home and was hooked right into the movie. The Shaw shank Redemption was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen and i am glad they did not make a sequel or it probably would have been a let down. this was very emotional and some scenes are hard to watch such has the raping scenes but also there was a lot of emotion between Andy Dufresne and red becoming friends and trying to live in this prison.it was very realistic in how prison life is hard and what it does to you after so many years. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in there roles. the ending where red goes and meets Andy in Mexico on the boat made the movie even better because it does not leave me with a feeling of emotional and sad feeling but emotional and happy feeling of friends meeting up again after a period of time and after going threw so much in prison. this movie was great and i recommend it to every one who likes to watch good films. my rating: 10/10.
680,True,"I had seen this movie quite a few years back, but still i vividly remember each and every dialogue,every character,every scene and even the background theme associated with every scene .The very name ""shawshank"" sends a chill down my spine.I was so deeply moved by the movie that it made my eyes feel watery for almost a week.The haunting soundtrack kept on lingering on mind and my urge to watch the movie resurfaced every now and then.***Spoilers ahead*** It's a poignant tale of an innocent man (banker) wrongfully convicted for committing a crime of passion (killing his wife and her lover).When he is sent to jail (Shawshank prison)for the aforementioned reason,he develops a special bond with a jail mate ""Red"" ( played by Morgan Freeman) supposedly the only guilty one at Shawshank.During his time in prison he comes across many harsh realities such as the dull eerie life in prison,the atrocities on prisoners and most importantly the real culprit behind the crime (the one who actually killed his wife).To exact his revenge he develops a master plan using his banking knowledge and outwits the jail guards by a surreptitious escape from prison to lead a new life in another part of the world.The movie scores in following aspects Dialogue:Witty , memorablejust simply great..and yeah not to mention the smart,strong and powerful narration by Morgan Freeman.Character formation:Every character carried some background information.Background score:That's the USP of this film..The background theme during the scene where Andy dufresne is brought into the Shawshank prison and the camera rolls high above the prison is just so mesmerizing.Acting: Top notch acting by the lead actors and backed well by the support cast.Story: Powerful,thought-provoking,tear-shedding and most importantly not a clichéd one.To sum up this movie gives a powerful message of hope and redemption .something we all seek in life."
681,True,"First, the Shawshank Redemption has been my favorite movie ever since I saw it for the first time a few years after its initial release. I know I have seen it more than 50 times and it never gets old. The film is a heart-wrenching tale of a falsely accused man forced to do a life term in prison due to an ironic twist of fate. Along the way, Andy makes friends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in higher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome of the story. The film has a dark side, too as the brutalities of everyday prison life come to the forefront. Also, the film possesses a lighter side with its portrayal of hope and faith and how those traits can rise out of desperation. This film is a must see, and anyone who watches it will undoubtedly laugh, cry, and wonder as they follow the trials and tribulations of Andy Defresne and his close circle of friends as they experience life behind bars inside the deep, dark, and dank Shawshank Prison."
682,True,"Yep I have to agree with so many others. I am a movie fan who usually watches about 5 a week on average. I actually keep track of every movie I watch in my own personal data sheet. This one is at the very top of my list.No movie I know of has better character development than The Shawshank Redemption. The movie has a few challenging scenes but most of it has a relaxed, even attractive quality to it. Just about anything Morgan Freeman does is good for me. I just can't help but like that man.I too thought this was Tim Robins' best role.I enjoyed the revenge component and somewhat happy ending even though it may have been a bit of a stretch.Great stuff. Good movie making. Good story writing. Great screenplay. Cinematography was appropriate. I felt like I was there with them."
683,True,"Small failures can't stop this movie from being grand, moving and very well made. In it's first, and elegants scenes, we see Andy Dufresne finding his wife and her lover dead, and then Andy being falsely Accused of murder and sentenced to prison. This first scenes although great, are not very important to the movie, because the movie does not turns around Andy's false accusation (We know that since the beginning), it's about what he learns and teaches inside the prison. Although Robbins's performance is not excellent, he gives the character an air of sadness, and in almost every scene of the picture, we can see through his expressions that he is always either angry because he is not supposed to be there, or upset because he can't find a way out of there. Despite the fact that this movie is not very original, and when I say that I'm remembering that it took a lot of elements from Don Siegel's ""Scape from Alcatraz"" (I mean, it can be coincidence, but don't you think that Brooks's raven is very is very similar in the story to the mouse of ""Scape from Alcatraz?), the movie covers it because it's always grabbing you on the screen , I mean, there wasn't a single moment in the whole movie that I thought was boring.Verdict: With a powerful moving story, charismatic characters (Especially Freeman's), this Excellent movie is a great study of agony and friendship."
684,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those one in a million type of films. The story is simple; innocent man gets falsely accused of murdering his wife, goes to prison for 20 years, escapes. You can't get any simpler than that, but that is the beauty of it. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman had their best roles in this film, and without a doubt Oscar worthy. The twists and turns, confrontations, inspirations, and most of all, hope make The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time. You can't help but smile at the end of the film, and maybe even shed a tear, but in any case The Shawshank Redemption is worth the watch over any other movie, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to see it as soon as possible. There will never be another film like this, but nevertheless, Shawshank will never be forgotten and will go down in history as being the most uplifting film ever."
685,True,"9.0Living in today's time, you might find yourself to be incredibly busy. Or you might find yourself to have nothing but time. Lots of time, and nothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and responsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other obligations/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for a little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the theater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your mind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite adventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying. Truth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the producers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject interesting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never go to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of the glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt you. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone even perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films know you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they aim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they definitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that ""spoke to you"", made you feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over nonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's because films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although often exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you. And the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you escape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into it with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the villain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow come to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've known them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly, as exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no reason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that life inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to earth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is painted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film for storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The human heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain, and even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to beat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has been lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and not let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the human being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of others, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors that are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for self judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for juries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving life sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain drunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some come as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time, there is one character that is static throughout all the film: the prison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance as well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison, that are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This is where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit gloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout the film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a character that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human heart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also manages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are capable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery, sorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times? Who's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank Redemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until it has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set you free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds us every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in ""the hole"", and forget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and find yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may find yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character Andy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, ""get busy living, or get busy dying."" And get busy watching The Shawshank Redemption."
686,True,"****Contains spoiler****I love the movie because it portrays great characters!As to my favorite character, Since all the characters in this movie are so unique and vivid, especially Red and Andy, I had been in a tough time to pick out my most favorite one. For God's sake, let me just elect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity between his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just Andy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a saying, ""never judge a book by its cover. "" I cannot describe it better than those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them：1. ""My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book"". - Stated by Andy, himself""You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you."" -- Cited from the Judge who sentenced AndyTommy: ""What's he in here for anyway?"" Red: ""Murder."" Tommy: ""The hell, you say."" Red: ""You wouldn't think it to look at the guy."" -- Cited from the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with Andy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the external appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help out. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more prisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high school equivalency. 2. ""I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man."" --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out that he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a group of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never gave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and educated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one cannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the gang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along with the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra money by finding the tax-deductible part.4. ""He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place."" -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a very rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he is still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the abuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no single shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal revenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his personality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the warden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the character Andy."
687,True,"Words of praise can't do enough justice for this film. There's something about it where you could watch it over and over and over and know everything that's gonna happen and still be shocked, saddened, and amazed by it as if you saw it for the first time. It just screams perfection: perfect story, acting, themes that are greatly worked into it without being too obvious. Part of the reason this is one of my favorites, maybe even my overall favorite film, is that it touches on so many world-essential things that everyone can relate to: hope, faith, integrity, justice, and the will to live and survive to name a few. I was shocked when I learned that this didn't win any Oscars. Although I do love Forrest Gump (the big winner of '94 which beat Shawshank for pretty much everything it was nominated in) and think that Tom Hanks did a brilliant job as Forrest, I still feel that Shawshank was slightly better. Morgan Freeman delivers what might be the performance of his career. There's so much believability in that it's just amazing. Tim Robbins is probably the only man who could have played Andy so perfectly. His quiet demeanor evokes great wonder about him, much like how Roy Orbison is such a presence on-stage and he hardly even moves. But the thing to really marvel about Andy is his integrity and patience. Although his need to escape could have driven him insane, his hope and faith in justice and God kept him sane enough to patiently work out his escape for 19 years. That meeting between Red and Andy where they discuss hope has to be one of the greatest scenes in the whole movie, next to Andy's ""resurrection"" baptism in the rain and when he breaks the sewage pipe with the stone in sync with the lightning. This film is much like another favorite of mine ""Citizen Kane"" because when it first came out people didn't really understand it that well and didn't see the prophetic power in it the first time around. But nowadays we as viewers have realized the impact and power that Shawshank holds on everyone who sees it. Every time it rains now, I just have the urge to run outside, take my shirt off, and just feel the rain pour down on me. I've seen this film maybe 10 times by now, and I know that I'll never stop watching it until the day that I die."
688,True,"First off... I really liked ""The Shawshank Redemption"".It's a movie that is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good prison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy ending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has become an ""aftermarket accessory"",so to speak. With only a ""so - so"" initial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be elevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world desperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the small man was becoming increasing powerless against ""Them"",heroes like Andy and Red,abundantly decent and ""ordinary"" raged against the machine on the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether ""Star Wars"", ""Lord of the Rings"" or the later ""Harry Potter"" series have built huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella could not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its immediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the audience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus weakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively short space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing that has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita Hayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had escaped? That apart,""The Shawshank Redemption""is a completely satisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James Cagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a special message,think it amongst the finest films ever made."
689,True,"Great films stir emotions. They have an impact that lasts long beyond the trip to the cinema. They give you an opportunity to reflect on your life, to ponder on the moments and they can inspire. The often misnamed 'Shawshank Redemption' (Scrimshaw Reduction?) was a box office failure when it came out in the UK in 1995. It's a story about 2 men, in prison in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and what happens to them... and that sounds pretty dull. But actually there is a simple message to this film and that is that hope is a good thing and nothing good ever dies. It's about the harsh and violent injustices that beset the central character including one of my personal greatest fears  being locked up for something I didn't do. The enigmatic Andy Dufresne goes on a 20 year journey of triumph in the face of adversity  a metaphorical and literal crawl through **** There are some powerful messages at play: that we can all become institutionalised in jobs or relationships, but that if we stick with them and believe in ourselves we will get to where we are aiming in the end. My passion for this film is that it is about life changing friendships and bonds between men which we quite often find difficult to express. It leaves a lump in the throat every time. Having seen it with my girlfriend, I went to see it two days later with my best friend and when it came out on video I rented it and watched it with my dad. It's a life affirmation film and when I'm fed up it never fails to give me the reminder that ""sometimes it all comes down to a simple choice  get busy living or get busy dying."" In my humble opinion, this is the greatest film of all time."
690,True,"This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I'm not so sure if it deserves to be the number one movie on IMDb, or how exactly it wound up there, but that aside I do really love it. You really feel for Andy and the rest of the prisoners in this movie. It's a shame to see the warden and prison guards having the power that they do over the inmates, especially since they are crooked, foul individuals.One great scene is that of Brooks after he is released. I can still remember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very nicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many of which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about. The finale when you find out that Andy had been tunneling out for twenty years was a very powerful one. It was amazing to think about how it was accomplished and how he never gave up hope.The story really drives this film and the script is terrific. The performance and characters are top notch and this movie should definitely be seen by anyone who is a fan of movies."
691,True,"Andy is a innocent man, who is thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit, he finds himself having to survive and in turn begins a life long friendship with another inmate.This film is raw and intense, it doesn't hide the brutal honesty of prison life. I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that are very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his rage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness as he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances, especially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the audience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is released; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable to find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after his old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls his way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out, while the rain falls on him. It's one the greatest moments in cinema, I began to breath once again; something I was unable to do throughout the film. Simply mesmerising."
692,True,"well...you normally don't find these types of movie all the time. In Shawshank you can see Tim Robbins at his best when compared to other movies...goes hand in hand with the plot...nd totally suits the Character to be resembled in the movie.Well this must be the best of Morgan Freeman..and as the movie reaches its climax it makes one more curious. As the movie moves towards its ending it thickens more involving one into it. Perfect plot , awesome Direction. The movie includes all it needs to show about prison life like violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars.Final ending is not at all predictable which forms a shocking climax.The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting, exciting and cathartic.This movie would always stay on the Top in my List."
693,True,"Well I bought this film and thought it would be a boring film about a prison, but no I was seriously wrong it has to be one of the most greatest films I have ever seen, portraying the beauty of friendship so strong that the world could hang upon. I was engrossed by the film entirely from start to finish, with it's humours, it's sadness, it's action. I was so wrong to buy with a half hearted feeling. I would recommend this film to anyone as the film they would most enjoy. My favourite part was right at the end where Red goes and finds the box and goes back to Andy and that scene on the beach was what got me; like a strike of lightning, so much I nearly cried. The part where Andy has the guts to go to a Hitler like man and talk to him about his finances goes to show that there are people in the world who can make the smallest difference but the biggest changes."
694,True,"a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory... this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstances it perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him. i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great. this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel. watch it and tell me it could not touch you Andy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory...this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstancesit perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him.i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great.this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel.watch it and tell me it could not touch youAndy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""
695,True,"So, i watched this film thinking it'd be pretty good. Was i wrong. It wasn't good, nor was it bad-it was perfect. It's hard to get a perfect film but i think this is a film that if you don't watch before you die your crazy. The story is an adaption of Stephen King's (when you hear that name you know it's going to be good) novel by the same name. It's about a prisoner put in jail for life for the wrong crime. He makes friends, people die, life moves on through his hardship until the chance to escape walks along. Overall 10/10, you could describe it with any word it'd still be awesome. Acting - Morgan Freeman was 10/10 in this, and through a lot of his movies. Tim Robbins made a character that was calm and cool and scared and worried etc. and could change through his emotions in a heartbeat. 10/10I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. It deserves to be top and if you don't think so cast your opinions because until then it'll just keep being perfect."
696,True,"I was not born when this movie came out so I have just had the chance to watch this movie and actually appreciate it recently and I must say I can see why this movie is recognized as one of the best movies of all times. The movie generally gets across human emotion and the acting and directing of everyone involved makes this movie a brilliant show alone. Not only is the movie well made but the story of it is fantastic and certainly does not mess up Stephen Kings novel. Even in it's near 3 hour runtime it does not ever get boring (and this is coming from someone who comes from the add generation) and always has a story to tell. Everything in this movie is important about the storytelling, from the main story to even Brooks story of him spending 50 years in prison and then being released and realizing he is completely dependent on the prison and has become used to being enclosed in its walls.Overall, the film is a masterpiece and I am glad I got to watch such a fantastic film. It is certainly up there in terms of the best movie of all time, and even though I am a little hesitant to call it the best, I would definitely put it in the top 10. I give this movie 96%."
697,True,"This is a movie that does not try to outsmart its viewer. It's a simple story of friendship and ""brotherhood"", of good and evil. One of the biggest things I got from this film is patience and determination. The way the lead character Andy Dufresne, put up with the ""wrongs"" throughout his life to finally be free. Traveling through 400 yards of sh*t to taste freedom speaks volumes of his lifelong battle. I cannot begin to count the times I've seen this movie. ""Shawshank"" is one of those movies that when you stumble upon it while channel surfing, you have to watch it until the end. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still weep at the ""Brooks was here"" scene and at the ending of the movie. Such a well cast movie, you grow a fondness for the characters good and bad. If I had to point out one flaw, it would be the ""Elvis"" prisoner..... but this is only a mere speck that cannot dull the shine of this outstanding movie. This is a movie that should have swept the Oscars in 1995. Between the writing and the acting performances, It's a ""no-brainer""."
698,True,"There aren't words too describe the greatness of this movie. The Directing is fantastic. The music, moving. The dialog, amazing. The story, exhilarating. Stephen Kings fantastic story of hope has been brought to the screen as my second favored movie of all time.Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) is a middle aged man who has been wrongly sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. With a lifetime to spend in Shawshank state prison he makes friends with an old timer at Shawshank, Ellis Boyd Redding(Morgan Freenman). Sfter a couple of years of abuse at the hands of the sisters (led by Mark Rolston) Andy makes nice with the guards and becomes the teachers pet of the prison. During his time at Shawshank Andy endures more hell than anyone could ever imagine. From a friend dying to 50 feet of unimaginable stench.This movie was not as well received as it should have been. It may have been nominated for a couple of Oscars but the viewer reception was just not to great. This movie is my favored only behind A Few Good Men."
699,True,"Adapted from a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption takes a prison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise on how to approach the business of day-to-day life in the face of a desperately Sisyphian reality. As the film's signature line suggests, ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."" Filmed on location in an Ohio prison, the film occasionally lapses into familiar formulas and well-known stereotypes of the prison-drama genre, but overcomes them due in no small part to a pair of transcendent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Director Frank Darabont and cinematographer Roger Deakins (a Coen brothers collaborator) recreate the drudgery and hopelessness of prison life in both the look and the details of dreary rituals of daily life. Spanning twenty years in the lives of its protagonists, Darabont's screenplay and direction allow us the luxury of getting to know these men -- hardened criminals, with little hope for the future -- through a series of quietly captivating scenes that slowly build atmosphere and tension without sacrificing characterization and thematic integrity. A critical success but a box office failure when it was first released, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, but won nary a one. Only when Shawshank was released on video did it steadily garner full-fledged public reverence."
700,True,"Few movies can get this critic watching them again and again, but Shawshank hits the mark on it's near flawless story and cinematography. With the brilliant acting of Morgan Freeman and as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, this adaptation of a Stephen King novella reaches out to audiences of all backgrounds.Comedy lovers need not be discouraged as The Shawshank Redemption is without comic relief to lighten the dramatic tensions laced within the movie.My one criticism though is that write/director Frank Darabont just had to yank that extra tear out of the audience. This was apparent in certain scenes as the one when Brooks Hatlen has too much ""trouble"" with his free life."
701,True,"why i think this is the best movie ever!!! ..... i think is the best movie ever cause u will never hear someone to tell u that he doesn't liked that movie (in any age that can understand about movies)!! so we have a movie that everyone likes no exceptions !!! do u know another movie that all people likes?? i am not sure there is !!! as example ,,, godfather ,,, perfect movie but for some people that they don't like the subject of the movie is not so good !!! ... so i think is good choice to be no 1!!.............................. ............................................................ ............................ any different opinions will be discussed!!!"
702,True,"Hope can set anyone free, imprisoned or not imprisoned, it affects us all.The shawshank redemption is not only the greatest movie i have ever seen, but it also consists of the greatest screen play I have ever seen. Morgan Freemen and Tim Robbins were casted perfectly, and it was the screen play that made it great. The scenery was great as welll, like when Red was walking out of the field andy told him to go to, and the crickets were flying all over the place. I loved watching how Morgan Freemen before on the bus before he got andys gift and after, Andy gave him hope and it set him free.The fact is this movie has it all. Screenplay, acting, scenery, and of course the little things that make the Shawshank deserving to hold the 1 spot on my list for greatest movies ever made"
703,True,"With the many other entries already here, I won't bore the reader with another synopsis. But hopefully, I will provide the details of one scene that sticks out so greatly in my memory because of the unbelievable (and fantastic) attention to detail that is not only here but is gloriously throughout this whole movie.Towards the end, Red (Morgan Freeman) is searching for something that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) left for him. Red has been paroled but the possibility still exists that he will either kill himself like Brooks or commit a crime just to get back into the safety of prison. His day job (bag boy at a local grocery store) is going nowhere.Months (possibly years) before, Andy gave Red directions on finding something very important if Red ever got out of prison. Red finally with nothing else left to do, follows up on that request. He travels a fairly long way (for him), across some difficult terrain and comes upon the scene described. Yet, it still requires searching and faith to uncover what Andy has left him.Finally, he finds it, and opens the contents, and his life is changed forever.What is so important is the minute detail of this scene  the location is not next to some superhighway but far off the most unbeaten path one could imagine. The object is not carelessly left under one rock, but under a number. Many people would have assumed they were in the wrong place after a few minutes of not finding the object and moved on.Finally, when Red does find it, he looks very furtively around him sure that someone must be watching him. He sits down, now practically hidden from any possible passers-by, and opens the object, and what he finds inside leads him to even more frightenedly glance around, sure now that there must be others watching, he must be found out, HE MUST STILL BE IN PRISON.This whole scene could have been done it about two minutes, a couple of quick cuts, him opening the box and discovering the contents and then a cut to the next scene. But, it isn't that at all, it is one of the most intricate scenes I have ever witnessed for what is a small advancement of the plot. But that's the catch. This is so important to the plot, that the scene had to be given this kind of detail, so that the viewer would completely understand what Andy was talking about and what Red had to discover. Red for all practical purposes was still in prison  and he wasn't living yet, he was still getting busy dying.At this moment in the movie, Red (and you the viewer) still doesn't know if Andy made it on the outside. He escaped, but where to? Yes there was that (more or less) cryptic postcard, but especially how did whatever Andy left for Red figure into the story? When would Andy have buried it? How did he know what to put inside it? Considering the search underway for Andy on the day following his escape, if I were Andy, as soon as I recovered the money from the banks, I would have been long gone, far, far out of the state of Maine. I certainly wouldn't want the warden walking into any of the banks and finding me there, and it would have taken several days for the newspaper to decide to publish the article and especially for the State Corrections officials to come down on the warden even with all the incriminating evidence. Andy needed to be gone for several months until all the hoopla had died down before he could return to actually bury the object. So, the intricacy of this scene now becomes clear as it really has to match the intricacy of Andy's planning for every detail This whole sequence is so important to the story, because it's now time for Red to decide if he should get busy dying or get busy living, because he now finally has the choice. Maybe this movie is more about Red's growth then about Andy's resilience. Andy always had his drive, Red needed to learn it. Andy gave him the courage to finally face his own demons and overcome them. Red now has his chance at redemption. Remember, Andy didn't commit any crimes, Red did. Andy really didn't need to be redeemed - Red needed it badly, The performances by Tim Robbins, especially when he tells Red of his request and Red imagines the worst, and of Morgan Freeman in this little scene are spectacular. I cannot possibly imagine any other actors pulling this off."
704,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. You can tell it is a great movie from the very beginning. Unlike many movies of the same type, the main character gets away, and the main villain gets what was coming too him. The Scene where Andy escapes is one of those scenes that will stick with you for a long time. It is without a doubt one of my favorite movie scenes. The way he is just stripping his clothes and throwing them on the ground, it really gives you a since for how emotional a moment it is for him. When he looks up at the sky, it just makes you want to cry. Hey that rhymed. Anyway, everyone should see this movie."
705,True,"This film captivates the imagination and gives all who watch it hope. For a film to put you to tears through happiness and sadness it really has to be something special. It has one of the greatest twists ever in film and has an ending that is unrivalled, it could not have been made any better. I have watched it maybe twenty times, its always an inspiration and an excellent tonic for those of us living a life we would like to change.The lines and the narration at the end are like poetry and the message of hope and human defiance is transcended to all. I can't recommend this film highly enough, it is an emotional roller-coaster but truly magical and will leave you warm inside.A masterpiece."
706,True,"I have no words to express the feelings I got after watching the climax of The Shawshank Redemption.Very few movies touch you and still fewer stays in you mind for a long time.Shawshank redemption managed to do both.In my opinion ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best movie to be made up to date.I don't really have to tell about Morgan Freeman,he is such a pleasure to watch.Some scenes are so poignant that you forget yourself.I particularly want to mention the scene in which Andy Dufresne plays the music in the loud speaker so that the prisoners be able to hear the wonderful music.The climax where Boyd Red reunites with Andy gives you a strange melodramatic feeling which only movies like Shawshank redemption,Forrest Gump gives."
707,True,"I was initially sceptical about watching this film, the movie's advertisements never held much appeal for me but seeing as though I was sitting bored on a Friday night I decided to give it a go.And from start to end I was engrossed The film really gives an accurate interpretation to what life inside a maximum security prison would have been like, I was left wincing several times during the inevitable outbreak of violence. The film contains something for everyone, there's sorrow, friendship, violence my main complaint was that there were a few elements I did not understand, particularly in the scenes that regard the accountancy work that the main character engages in.The acting was unforgettable, Tim Robbins deserves credit as the main seemingly devoid of all feelings, yet with that certain characteristic about him, Morgan Freeman as usual shines through as the man who can 'get things' and my personal favourite Clancy Brown as the sadistic hard ass security captain.I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, it is without a doubt one of the great classics of our time."
708,True,"This movie is absolute perfection. The story is about a bank teller, Andy, (Robbins)who is wrongfully imprisoned for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Red (Freeman) becomes his best friend. The movie progresses by showing the life that Andy has to endure in prison. For example, he becomes a prime target by a few homicidal sodomites and obviously has to fight them off, which ends with him in the infirmary.The movie is excellent because it shows a very accurate portrayal of prison life, and the corruption within the prison by the blood thirsty power crazed guards, and the so called religious and honest warden, who is really a greedy sadistic manipulator who takes advantage of Andy by forcing him to do his taxes and make him work to make him rich.This movie may very bell be the best movie you ever see. It's real, it's dramatic, funny and has everything that a good drama needs. WATCH IT!!!"
709,True,"Perhaps the best line in the film can also be used to describe this film; a caged bird (the film) that shouldn't be locked up (at the video store).""The Shawshank Redemption"" can be described in only one word: Powerful.It is my favorite movie.Let me give you a short summary. Andy Drufesne (pronounced Dufrene; and played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham)), the vice president of a large Portland, Maine bank, is given a life sentence in Shawshank Prison after he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, run by religious Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and sadistic Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). He befriends fellow prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy)). Over a few decades, Andy befriends the inmates, begins a library, education system and work program. But Andy is innocent, and has trouble convincing the authorities of that, and the film works up to the inspirational and excellent climax.Robbins and Freeman blend into their roles like chameleons, and the script is well written.I will sum up the review in this one statement: go see it.You will not be disappointed."
710,True,"Hope is a good thing - this is the best quote for me from the movie. When I am depressed, I watch this movie, and there is not a single time I have not felt good.From the very first scene, with a drunk and disturbed Andy, to the last scene, with a free and relieved Andy - I enjoy all the moments. You don't watch some movies, but you start feeling them, and believe me, it is one of them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceedingly good in this movies and so is the storyline. Some of the best moments of the movie are - Andy winning beer for his co-workers (yes, Andy refers to his prison mates as co-workers), Andy resisting the violent advancements from the homosexual prisoners and getting beaten up each time but still never giving up, Andy playing the music record without giving an ear to the warden, Brooks struggling to live his post-prison life and finally committing suicide, the warden madly asking the poster about Andy and finally discovering the tunnel, Red getting the parole approved, Red finding the stone and Andy's stuffs and above all, Morgan Freeman's narration. The script of the narration is brilliant and Morgan Freeman's baritone gives it the needed effect.If you love true cinema, this is a movie for you. If you have not watched it, do it now!!! If you have watched it, I am sure you must have done it more than once. The movie deserves it..."
711,True,"Andy is a former banker accused of killing his wife and he goes to prison. They are all innocent of course. He is treated poorly as a lot of prisoners are but he forms bonds with other inmates, especially an inmate named Red. From within the prison Andy helps with the formation of a library and helps others with money woes. There are good positive things in this movie but for the most part, it is a dark and cruel movie. It has a certain sadness that brings about it's greatness. The most important thing about this movie are the friendships that develop within a dark place. I liked Jake a lot and thought that was such a metaphor for freedom although Brooks didn't know any other life. I also loved the ending and thought that it was the perfect way to end a movie."
712,True,"Kids who play unorganized games of baseball, basketball, or football will often make use of a ""do over"". The ""do over"" happens when the kids can't agree on exactly how legal a play was, whether there was a penalty, or what exactly happened. That particular play is forgotten and the game proceeds. This film is about a life ""do over"".By all measures Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was successful: he was a banker, married to a beautiful wife, and living in a pleasant home. When his wife is murdered, he is convicted and sent to prison. While not guilty of murder, he convicts himself for neglecting his wife and - it is hinted - his privileged life. Prison forms the environment for even harsher penalties for this crime. Ironically in his endurance Andy finds a deeper appreciation for simpler things: friendship, opera arias, and a cold beer after hard work on a hot day.Red (Morgan Freeman) is also serving a life sentence for murder. He slowly becomes Andy's best friend. Red is the prison's unofficial retailer and a peerless guide for Andy in survival. It is through Red that Andy gathers a close ring of friends.Andy's hope is born from the prison warden's avarice and hypocrisy. Using his banking skills Andy is able to reward the warden's greed and his friends. Andy organizes a prison library where Red and his circle work.Andy realizes he must act after the Warden reveals the full extent of his insatiably evil appetite by murdering the only person who could prove his innocence.This is a long movie but like all great movies that isn't noticed. While it is guilty of being in the common genre of prison movies and having the sort of clichéd ending for which Hollywood is canonized, lionized, cursed and scandalized, the true measure of this movie is that it still delivers a potent story. This is hope for the hopeless.Zihuatanejo!"
713,True,"I've seen thousands of films and this is by far one of the best I've ever seen. This is one of the rare films that was better than the book. It was taken from Stephen Kings short story ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I am a huge Stephen King fan and also enjoyed the story very much. This movie blew me away. I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan but he is perfect fit this role. Morgan Freeman is great in this just like he is in everything he does. This film has some of the best lines in it. When Morgan Freeman is narrating and says ""The only one I know that could crawl through a river of $hit and come out clean on the other side..."" It gives me goosebumps. If you have never seen this you should go out and buy it today."
714,True,"I remember seeing this movie back when it first came out. I have watched it several times since then. I really like this movie, but in my opinion their are a lot of movies that are much better. When I look at the top 250 I cringe at this one. I think that movies like this belong among the top 250, but I feel that this one lacks what is needed to be towards the top of that list. Movies such as citizen kane, clockwork orange, or pulp fiction should not be lower on the list than this one. A good movie is one that is well written and acted. A great movie is one that redefines movie making and does something that has not been done before, or at least something that is going to be remembered forever. The godfather deserves top billing on the list. It was very well written, very real and had lines that are repeated daily in movies, television or in talk around the coffee pot. All I remember from shawshank is Tim Robbins hands in the air after he escapes."
715,True,"I saw this movie while still in university, kind of gloomy at first. while after several unexpected sharp turns , everything is clear with the sun rising above the horizon. I was totally shocked by the development of the plot with the protagonist trying an unusual means to get out of the prison and finally realized his dream of being free , unbelievable and amazing! Redemption of the sincere prisoners. Redemption of justice. With the movie coming to an end, the bad were doomed, the good were redemption ed. It should be like this. Life cycles. Man proposes, God deposes. That is the meaning of life, I think so.Meanwhile, without the support of these two excellent main characters, this movie can hardly be as good as this."
716,True,"This story takes place in prison but that is not to say it is a prison movie, because The Shawshank Redemption is so much more.In all reality this movie is a story about human nature at it's worst and best. It's about friendship and loss, full of emotion, irony, humor and nostalgia. All wrapped around one hell of a satisfying plot twist and revenge sequence against the story's antagonists you'll probably ever see.The icing on this scrumptious cake is one hell of a divine original scoring from composer Thomas Newman, the man who scored The Green Mile and American Beauty. It is haunting and often very moving. I realize that for many people one small segment of music in even a great film isn't enough to invoke a desire to watch the entire film. However there is a approximately 10 second segment of the score near the end of the film that will break your heart. You'll know which segment I mean if you see this film and if you're the right kind of person with a good soul, it will move you to tears. Somehow the movie manages to pull off an epic feel despite the backdrop being prison bars and walls. You really feel you've gone through the years with the two main characters in the film, by the end you really feel for these characters as if they were your friends. Making the end of their journey in this film affect you strongly. I would call this the best prison movie ever but for the fact that it really isn't a prison movie more than truly magnificent story that happens to take place in prison. This is however one of the best films ever made and I highly recommend it. This movie, especially the last 15 or 20 minutes will stay with you for years to come. It haunts me to this day."
717,True,"Far and away, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserved, with every fiber of its being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who, until ""Million Dollar Baby,"" had been robbed of an Oscar for films such as ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" had his pinnacle performance for ""TSR."" Beautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with Freeman's narration, ""TSR,"" for all its gray colors, paints an exuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating an escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and enemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it into a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving his time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I haven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening, or what mood I'm in, if ""TSR"" is playing...I'm watching, and loving it just as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, ""What the hell's wrong with me?"""
718,True,"i just love this movie. It is a must see for absolutely everyone. even if you end up hating it you will be better off seeing it than not :) there are reasons why the film should not have worked and reasons why it should, but because of the brilliant cast and excellent directing and adaption of Stephen kings novella this has become one of the best films ever created and is superb in its entirety. i remember watching it for the first time when i was about 15 years old and it had been recorded and i missed the ending of the film, it cut out just after Andy fell out of the sewage pipe in his escape. I couldn't believe it, i had to spend ages trying to attain a copy of the film so i could finish watching it and well it as definitely worth it :) i have given this film a 10/10 and deservedly so. it is inspiring and brilliant"
719,True,"This movie was nothing short of amazing. I had watched it a couple years after it came out but I rented it recently and I have watched it over and over. The acting is amazing, the suspense is great and the events in the movie are gut wrenching, tear jerking and sometimes even stomach turning. This movie shows you what some prisons can be like in some places at different points in time. The cast is great, with Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who is sentenced to 2 back to back 20 year life sentences for ""murdering his wife"", Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red'Redding, an old man who has done years for a murder he committed when he was a teenager, Andy and Red become good friends in prison, there is also Clancy Brown who plays Captain Byron T. Hadley, a vicious prison guard with no remorse or conscience, and Bob Gunton plays Warden Samuel Norton, a crooked prison warden. I highly recommend this movie to anyone fit to watch a movie so disturbing in scenes. So go out and buy this movie, you don't even have to rent it to see if you like it, trust me, you will. I'd buy it but it isn't exactly an easy one to find here.10/10--Amazing..Highly Recommended"
720,True,"I've seen some of the most famous movies of all time Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, On the Waterfront, Gone with the Wind, etc; But this is my all time favorite movie, Morgan Freeman is unbelievable as Red, same goes for Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, This is a Movie about a man named Andy Dufresne who is imprisoned for not 1... but 2 life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, while in prison he meets a fellow inmate by the name of Ellis Boyd Redding mostly known as Red. And they go through so much together, the ending makes me so happy inside that Andy and Red are able to meet on the outside and live the rest of the lives on the outside."
721,True,"What can one say about the Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said. I remember when it came out but refused to see it because of the title although I am a big fan of both stars. Besides, I had gotten so burned by critics saying that this movie is a four star or that one only to go and see them and find that the movies mentioned were ordinary or most certainly not the four stars the critics gave them. Even Roger Ebert is guilty of this. So, because of bad information I usually wait for the DVD to come out and that's too bad because I'm denying a good movie some money it could use in it's theatrical release. But so many movies coming out just isn't worth my money. I saw the Shawshank Redemption in rental and turned around and bought a copy. I like prison movies anyway from the TV movie Against the Wall, the story about Attica to the Chicano epic Bound by Honor to the great OZ my all time favorite prison story. The Shawshank Redemption transcends most prison movies because it has heart and is told in such a leisurely fashion that you can absorb it and enjoy the art and superb dialog and the brilliant acting without feeling hurried. Many posters have already commented on this wonderful movie and although I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever made I do enjoy it and am glad that it's in my library."
722,True,"Shawshank Redemption is truly an inspirational film--a work of art. What makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in your darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the murder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his life in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb kid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in prison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by ""the sisters"" and manipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He gains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on Robbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel Welsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time. Something that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those posters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom. I'll spoil no more for you...but recommend you watch this film yourself. It's quite inspiring and uplifting.9/10"
723,True,"Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the ""man who can get things."" Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time."
724,True,"I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" last night with my husband, partly to see what the fuss was all about. I found it a well made moving film, but a little too sentimental. Red's character was complex. He was very noble (well, he is played by Morgan Freeman) but he was in prison for being a murderer, and the speech he made to the parole board at the end of the film showed his dilemmas and the darker side of his personality. Andy was complex too as the other prisoners saw. I thought the characters were too clichéd in the way that the warden and the guards were bad, the prisoners were good, except for a group of prisoners (the Sisters) who were bad. Aside from Andy and Red, the characters fit clearly on one side of the good/bad divide. I would have liked to see more sides of their personalities. The film delivers some surprises by the end: it was wonderful not to have any inkling of Andy's escape, his plans for revenge, or his gift to Red, providing Red with his freedom. The script develops the story skillfully and makes the audience care deeply about the prisoners, not just Andy and Red. I would have liked to know what happened to the prisoners after the corrupt warden and the bullying guards were arrested. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tells a powerful story well, but it would have an even more powerful punch if it allowed more time to discover the prisoners' inner natures: the darker tone of the ""fishing"" scenes at the start really isn't returned to. I loved Banks' pet crow and the nod to ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". That film was a strong portrait of both the Birdman and the experience of being in a prison. Ultimately, I didn't feel that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gives a picture of what it's like to be a prisoner locked away in a corrupt institution for decades. For one thing, I can't see an entire population of a prison reacting to Mozart on the loudspeaker with awe: surely there must have been more prisoners who prefer Hank Williams."
725,True,"at the first time I saw the movie, I had a high expectation on this movie, due to its position in IMDb.com..then, I watched this movie, expecting what is called one of the best movies ever, and when the credits came up...I was speechless...indeed, this movie looks simple, and sentimental... nevertheless, I have to admit its perfection..in terms of pacing, music, acting, movie length, twist, and ending...I've been comparing this movie to other movies around, still I find this better than those...even the classic ones...I'm still looking for another contender for the best movie ever, but yet, this movie still tops all of them...11 out of 10"
726,True,"Shawshank Redemption is one of the most insightful and thought provoking movies I have seen. With the character ""Red's"" narration, it comes across a little like a documentary because of the details of prison life presented. But we are being told a story in such a way as to keep us interested enough to hear the outcome.I view the character, Andy (at least later in the movie) as an undetected mouse in a board meeting or fly on the wall who observes more than the average person. Red describes him as wearing some kind of cloak that shields him from the effects of the prison. This is revealed as hope later on. Andy somehow refuses to allow his hope to be crushed or snuffed out.He accomplishes so much during his incarceration, much of it due to his undaunted perseverance and redirected energy. It is brilliant and insanely brave when he asks the guard if he trusts his wife. Pushed to the brink of destruction, he barely gets the words out to the effect that the guard can keep all of the inheritance if he gifts it to his wife.The story reminds me of the Biblical Joseph in an Egyptian prison, a documented instance of undeserved confinement.The spoiler that I have for those already initiated is: Andy places his own copy of the Bible in the warden's safe the evening of his planned escape. The warden is mocked when he reads his own quote to Andy inside the cover and the hollow for the pick-ax is revealed. I wonder if Andy's routine included locking up the warden's Bible, or was this a one time sting for the warden's sake?"
727,True,"I wrote my first review of this movie back in 2006. I feel I did not do it the justice it deserved.I grew up in Mansfield, OH, not very far at all from the Ohio State Reformatory. The old ""castle Dracula"" Administration building is all that is left now. A new prison (Mansfield Correctional Institution) was built on the site where the other buildings existed along OH-13. I remember the impending demolition just waiting for this movie to finish filming......Thank God it waited! The story begins in 1946 when Portland banker Andy Dufresne is tried for and wrongfully convicted of the double murder of his wife and her ""lover"".Andy arrives at Shawshank state prison in early 1947 and is greeted harshly by ruthless authority and by thugs who seem to enjoy beating him up. Andy keeps strong and keeps very much to himself for the first two years.Andy finally decides he needs a hobby to keep his mind occupied. He approaches the well known prison entrepenour, ""Red"", and asks if Red might smuggle something into the prison for him... This kick starts the relationship between Red and Andy that the movie centers its attention on.There is a gentle tug of war between the two regarding ideals. Red, guilty of murder and sentenced to life with parole, sees no hope in existence outside of the prison walls. He tries, throughout the film, to convey to Andy that ""hope can drive a man insane"" and its best to just accept your fate. Opposites must attract because Andy was Red's polar opposite and it began to catch Red's attention. Andy would confront the police guard to ask for beers for his friends. He'd play music over the Shawshank PA system from the Warden's office. He'd write the state once or twice a week for years and years to get funds for a new library. Andy Dufresne dared to dream and he turned the negativity of Shawshank on its head...and just may have changed Red's view on things.The villain in the movie is Warden Norton. The Warden notices Andy's skills and intelligence early on and took full advantage. He entices Andy to be sort of an ""administrative assistant"". He started out in doing tax returns for the guards, which he was very good at. In time, the Warden enticed him to use his banking skills to mastermind a money laundering scheme that would make the Warden ""a millionaire when he retires"". Andy had to ""go to prison to be a crook"". This kept his mind occupied.About 2/3 the way through the film, a young kid is admitted to Shawshank who knows who killed Andy's wife 19 years before. Andy is ecstatic and he takes the news to the Warden. At risk of the money laundering scandel being brought to light, the Warden ensures Andy he's not leaving Shawshank. Andy gets two months in the hole. The young kid gets shot.Andy, the beacon of hope for this movie, decides HE WILL get out. And HE WILL get his freedom.We go back to Andy's first meeting with Red 19 years before the escape...the little chess piece chiseling 6"" rock hammer that he asked for... He'd been chipping away at the concrete wall in his room for 19 years and NOBODY SAW IT COMING.Andy busts out of that stinkin place, crawls through a 500 yard sanitary line and ""comes out clean on the other side"". Andy is gone and is free like a bird.Red, with his inspirational friend gone, does begin to lose that hope that Andy almost convinced him of. Life at the prison begins to suck. Red, after 40 years, gets paroled. He has no idea how to adapt on the outside. He might just commit suicide.Only one thing stops him...a promise he made to Andy... Determined, Red puts on his hat and suit, clamps his travel case shut. Give busy livin, or get busy dyin...thats god damn right. He bolts town and meets up with Andy on the beach in Mexico. Red, once a young crook, now redeemed old man."
728,True,"Some individuals get bored with the beginning of the movie because of the slow pace, but one has to remember this isn't about action its about drama and a well told story, and the ending makes me smile every time. The well chosen dialog in the start shows the viewer this is not about your normal prison movie or any sorta of manner that could be included in that genre, but instead has well thought out banter. The cinematography is nothing new to any of us but thats not so important as the story and the way the angles show what need to be shown. Simplely put its a beautiful story, well written by King and is shot and made very worth peoples while. My mother watched it for the very first time a few weeks ago, before always complaining that it was boring and she could never get into it, now she sings it praise."
729,True,"""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."" What a great tag line. It makes you think of how good your life is when you get to be free.It is hard for me to put my feelings into words because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of that kind of movies that makes you think. The movie has been very educating for me.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not an ordinary prison-movie. It is an epic story about friendship. I almost start to weep when I think of Red (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and Andy's (excellent Tim Robbins) strong relationship! In the film Tim Robbins' character, banker Andy Dufresne is being accused to have murdered his wife and his lover while they were having an intimate moment. The jury finds the defendant guilty as charged and Andy is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison which was known for its cruel punishments for misbehaving. While being a new meet in prison Andy is being harassed by the Sisters, inmates who want to taste some of that fresh meet. Everything happens on Red's point of view. Red is the guy who can get almost anything you want by smuggling stuff in. He is a provider who will someday give Andy the key; Rita Hayworth.The film is full of injustice but even if you are locked up you can find your soul-mates. Also after being imprisoned for a long time it will grow on you. It becomes your home. But not for Andy. He knows he's innocent. Maybe the Shawshank isn't so hard to crack...""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on a short story by no other than king of horror Stephen King. I have found his prison-movies to be very very good because, well, the pictures about his stories have always been little downbeat. Maybe because of the supernatural side, I guess. I have this short story on my bookshelf and it's almost as same as the movie. The only thing's that different in the short story is that Red was a ginger-haired, white Irishman. Freeman's Red is also Irish but we all know the difference. It doesn't make any difference, really.The lesson of this movie is to never give up hope. Life can sure kick you but kick back. Be smarter than life.""I hope I can get across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope that the Pasific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."" -Red"
730,True,"I doubt anyone can argue, that this Movie is the greatest one ever made. If there is no better movie ever made I will not be disappointed. More about that later though, one of the movie's strongest aspects, the acting.Before watching this movie I had never heard of Tim Robbins, and after was left wondering why, the way he developed the character of Andrew Dufresne was incredible, why he hasn't been in many, many more big productions.But the real star in this Movie was Morgan Freeman,maybe it was because he's Irish, his role as Red the 'The man who knows how to get things' was incredible. A convicted murderer, and the only guilty man in shawshank really was what made the movie, amongst other things, so good. He would have to be the best narrator EVER!! he makes you feel as though when he speaks, you're him watching the events unfold as they happen from his perspective.The other co-stars all put in great performances, notabley Bob Gunton as the Warden, William Sadler as Heywood a fellow inmate and James Whitmore as Brooks. Clancy Brown did a great job of making you hate his character Captain Hadley, at some parts you just wanted reach through the screen and kill him yourself. And Mark Rolsten as Boggs the gay prisoner, made you shudder.But the highlight of the acting was on the on screen chemistry between Tim Robbins and Morgn Freeman the best male lead duo that I have ever seen, the way they inspire each other and the conversations they share add another dimension to the movie.The plot is good, with the ending coming as a complete surprise to me, probably because i was expecting something a little different to what I had expected, which is what makes this movie brilliant. Frank Darabout has done a great job as Director as he has shown us again later in the Green Mile. I cant believe this film did not perform in the Cinemas or did not win any awards. Words cannot possibley describe in detail just how good this movie is, go and see it for yourself, but be prepared for some real, prison violence. And remember, a good thing never dies."
731,True,"There is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for the first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an extraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until we see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot with a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity. The view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The effect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod Stieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that it's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch something very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be the hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or not. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some hysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his first night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named 'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his other abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia that makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some little respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in common with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an innocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well matched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible - assisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the extremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that too.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very hour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be possible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both stretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes in search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped in the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of summer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and distant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The contrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things to savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly counterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address parallels of endurance and relationships from male or female perspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics and CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a decent telly with a quality independent sound-system."
732,True,"It's hard to imagine that maybe the most uplifting film of all time is set inside the walls of a prison but that is the case in The Shawshank Redemption. The film is about friendship, loyalty, and patience which may not seem like the most intriguing elements until you have seen them brought together in this film. Opening with the incarceration of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) for two life terms for the brutal killing of his wife and her lover the film seems to be heading into dark territory. Instead what we get is an examination of the triumph of human spirit. Shawshank Prison is the meanest prison around, or so says Ellis""Red""Redding(Morgan Freeman) in an early narration. This is where Red and Andy first meet and where the development of one of the most rewarding screen friendships begins. Tim Robbins who plays Andy gives his best performance. He carries himself in a manner unimaginable considering his predicament. His patience and strength are a marvel. Morgan Freeman turns in the performance of his career as Red who narrates the film as well as provide the realism that Andy has suppressed back. Andy is a patient man who walks the yard of Shawshank like he doesn't have a care in the world. The film's success lies in the relationship between Andy and Red. Their friendship carries them through the struggles of the prison term and us through the film. One of the most memorable endings in film history comes from their life long bond. I am being vague on details because I do not want to spoil the film for anyone who has not seen it. As far as I am concerned it is something that you should do immediately. The Shawshank Redemption does so much well. But above all it is a story of hope. The ability to persevere through any situation is the hallmark of this remarkable film."
733,True,"I'm just wondering or if we get told in some way if the letter that Andy had sent to the newspaper from the bank had any information about his innocents in the murders of his wife and her lover. This is because Capatin Hadley was arrested outside the prison and the only way that I could see this happen is if Andy had sent some information in that letter to the paper.I'm also just wondering if Norton had any sort of information about Andy's innocents. I haven't read the book ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" which is roughly based on the movie. It would be nice if I could get a reply from someone who has an answer too one of these questions."
734,True,"I remember the first time I watched this movie. I was only 10 and i had turned on the TV to watch and i saw this movie called the Shoshana redemption and i thought what a interesting name. But the movie wouldn't have been excellent without the awesome casting of Tim Robbins(Andy), Morgan Freeman (Red), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), James Handy (Brooks) and Clancy Brown (Captain Byron Hadley). The movie conveys lots of mixed messages but the most important to me is that even though we can be in dark and scary places there can always be light. Only fault that as the years went by, Morgan Freeman didn't look his age. Other then that it was a good movie with a good message that you keep watching over and over again."
735,True,"This is by far the most underrated movie ever made. The movie itself is just so well done that I don't ever get tired of seeing it. I found out about it 2 years after it came out and since then it's made an impression on me that affects me even to this day. The movie is brilliance and it's done so well that it upsets me to know that it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. But it's a similar thing that paralleled The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind in 1939 it did it again in 1994 with The Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump. This movie though as whole is one of the best films put together that shows morale code, fear and hope. It shows what can be taken from us, from freedom or someone (Tommy getting killed) from any situation that was put together but hope stays with us and cant be beaten or stolen from us unless we let it and this movie shows us that in an honest way that isn't exaggerated. To me I'll never get tired of seeing this movie nor get tired of what it means. Hope."
736,True,"After watching this movie, you come to think about how important and valuable your freedom really is.I think everyone should watch this movie. The story is very well shown and played, the actors were amazing and I didn't see any failure except that eventually, the end goes by really fast, but maybe it's better like this, when the happy things aren't described, your imagination can make the most wonderful story out of it.On the not so good series, I'd point the captain of the guards, who seemed to have some good feelings at some moments of the movie, and who ended killing the young guy in such a pitiful and disappointing way. Also the director of Shawshank died without getting what he should have receive for being such a bastard, which was quite unfair.But well, the worst punishment you could get, is not physical, nor material, it's when you discover you ruined your life, and lost your time.I gave this movie a 9, because nobody and nothing is perfect.I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this, even if it takes away 2 hours of your free time, this movie could make you realize how to spend the remaining ones of your life in the most clever way.GO FREEDOM ! :-)"
737,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. Ranked 2 in the top 250 films it is clear others agree with me. And when you watch this you will too. The plot may sound familiar (guy goes to jail, guy escapes jail) but this is nothing like i have seen before. It's about Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) determination and persistence which keeps him going through his 19 years. But the film is also about Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) commonly known as ""Red"". He does not claim innocence and is the only guilty man in Shawkshank. When Dufresne arrives Red makes a bet he'd be first to crack. But Andy stays strong which surprises Red. He uses this strength to keep going day after day and he passes this feeling onto Red when he tells him of a box planted under the tree. This gives Red some hope, It gives him something to look forward to and that will keep him going day by day. Without Andy Red would have nothing in life. And when you have nothing in life like Brooks did... There is nothing to keep you going onto the next day. This film is brilliantly scripted. The acting is top class and you get the feel of the innocent man amongst the guilty. The corrupt guards and wardens add to Andys story of wrong convictions and unfairly treated. He just happens to be the only innocent man in Shawshank."
738,True,"*Possible SpoilerI was fifteen years old at the time this film was released, and it instantly became one of my favorite films after the first time I watched it. Part of the film was shot 10 minutes from where I grew up at the Wyandot County Court House in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. A classmate of mine's father was a juror in the opening scenes of the film. The rest of the film was shot about 45 minutes from my home in Mansfield, Ohio at the historic Mansfield Reformatory. Every year, the famous prison has haunted tours and sleepovers during the Halloween season, and is open for historic tours during other parts of the year. There are many websites devoted to this site. Being a fairly rural area of the state, it is quite an honor to have lived near the filming of one of the best films of all time. As I have grown into an adult, I have grown to appreciate the artistic value of the film even more. Morgan Freeman delivers his best performance (all of his are great though). ""Red"" is the epitome of a man who just wants to be part of life. Although confined inside walls, he can function normally by doing things to make others happy, in turn making himself happy. He is much like any working man that lives on the outside. Andy (Tim Robbins) just amazes you with his selflessness. He sacrificed his own well-being for others many times during his stay at the Shawshank. It took him a longtime, but his desire to live eventually freed him. The film left me surprised many times. But once you have got to know Andy, nothing he does will surprise you. He's the guy you knew back in the day that had all the luck. (We've all known guys or girls like that). This film is 10 out of 10. It has moments of suspense, mystery, action, surprise, drama, sadness, and even a little comedy if you know where to look for it."
739,True,"The ending of this movie might be the most rewarding ending I've ever seen, from a movie-goers point of view. Not only is Andy an innocent man, it seems he suffers more than all the guilty men around him. After he climbs out of the sewer and tastes freedom after decades of unjust imprisonment, his passion for his newly found freedom is almost palpable from the theatre seat or my home sofa (wherever I'm watching it). I challenge you to find a movie with a better ending. Questions: Is Andy raped by the ""sisters"" or no? I thought Morgan Freeman's voice-over was kind of unclear on this point. Number two. What are the odds that the tin box that contains the money and note wouldn't be all rusted out?"
740,True,"1 VERY MINOR SPOILER INCLUDED.I will openly admit that the whole reason I watched this movie is because it is ranked number 2 on the IMDb top 250. I will further admit that, yes, the movie is great. But #2 of all time? Mmmmm... no. There aren't particularly any flaws with the film, aside from the fact that it spans a 20 year period and nobody seems to age at all. The performances are stellar and it desrves to be lauded as a great film. If you haven't seen it, see it, you will be glad you did. I was."
741,True,"Complete void of spoilers herein, only read on if you like ridiculous praise of a movie on a mammoth scale.I just watched The Shawshank Redemption for the second time, and for the second time it took my breath away. There is just no real word to describe the extraordinary piece of cinema that has been created here.It tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), and his story of survival inside a maximum security prison, aided by his friendship with 'the only guilty man inside Shawshank', Ellis 'Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman). Along the way it branches into at least six different side stories that, halfway through the movie, while still entertained, one wonders what they have to do with the plot. The answer is everything, as becomes apparent by the end.I won't bore you with details of the individual craftsmanship that went into this movie, but I will advise anyone who has not seen it to see it, and as soon as possible. Keep watching until the end, and there is no possible way you can be disappointed. It is absolutely masterly directed by Frank Darabont, and while I thought that his other Stephen King-based film, The Green Mile, was fairly slow and self-indulgent, this isn't. It is drawn out and long, but absolutely impeccable and amazingly inspirational. It delivers the message that even in the face of abject adversity, hope will always prevail. This message was recently hammed up quite terribly in ""The Two Towers"", but in The Shawshank Redemption, just one very simple quote sums it up: ""Hope is a good thing. Possibly the best thing. And no good thing ever dies""This is one for the ages. I cannot imagine that the uplifting effect of this movie will ever die. There is no possible way it could be better. The only possible reason I can think of for not liking or being inspired by this movie is that you just don't want to. There are no two ways about it. Even after nine years, this holds strong as an absolute masterpiece of film-making, and a staggering achievement. Five stars out of five."
742,True,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS (nothing too specific)**Watching The Shawshank Redemption is a downright religious experience; it is truly a film to treasure, and one that nobody who sees it will ever forget. Director Frank Darabont's translation of a Stephen King novella to the screen is not a great film because of the story itself-the plot is actually quite simple and could be carried out in under an hour with relative ease-but because of the way the story unfolds.  Shawshank is a lengthy film (clocking in around 150 minutes), but it doesn't feel so long because the leading actors are spot-on perfect, the pace is beautifully metered, and the emotions (which are never the least bit contrived) build to one of the tensest climaxes in American cinema.The story is told not from the perspective of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), banker imprisoned for a double-homicide he didn't commit, and the main character in this epic tale, but from the perspective of Red (Morgan Freeman), `the only guilty man in Shawshank Prison.'  Red has been in Shawshank for twenty years; he's a well-liked inmate among his peers because he's the guy that can obtain some of the luxuries of the outside world. If you want a box of cigars or a poster of your favorite pin-up girl, Red's your man.  Often, throughout the course of the film, we wonder why Andy isn't telling the story-after all, he's the character we sympathize with most.  In the end, we know why, and we're glad Red told the story, since the film ends up being more about him than Andy.  Andy, instead, is just the vehicle for Red's realization that hope and perseverance can free the human mind.While Red is the resourceful handyman, Andy is the smartest man in Shawshank.  He hatches a plan to get the other inmates to accept him by having the guards provide them with alcohol, he comes to be the tax preparer for all the guards in Shawshank as well as several neighboring prisons, he revamps the prison library, and even becomes the personal accountant to the warden, a cold man who, we learn, is just as criminal as any inmate.  Yet all the while, we don't realize just how smart Andy Dufresne is.  We believe he'll get his revenge on the legal system that landed him in jail, but this movie isn't about vengeance.  It's about making the most of a bad situation, and about the lengths a person will go to free himself-physically and spiritually.The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 and lost all of them, mostly to Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (both solid films in their own right).  In any other year it may have won all seven.  Freeman definitely deserved every possible accolade for his performance, while Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' stark cinematography bring great effect to the story.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most successful films ever on video, and rightfully so.  It's one of the best films ever."
743,True,"The first time I've seen this movie was on December 31st, 2001. My parents and I were getting ready to down to the city and celebrate the New Year.My father said it was a great film and it was just on TNT or TBS. I decided to watch it, and wow. This has to be the greatest film of all-time.The acting was excellent, the directing, the writing. Everything. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gave excellent jobs. On my all-time favorites list, this ranks #3...1. ""Rat Race"" (2001) 2. ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) 3. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) 4. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) 5. ""Spider-Man"" (2002)The only bad aspect of the film was that the ending was too weak.SPOILER ALERTWhen Freeman's character met Robbin's character on the beach, it was just dull. I don't even think they ever said a word. They just faded out. Couldn't they have shown what happens next? Oh, well.SPOILER ALERT OVER.Everything else was great and there were even some funny moments, like when the Prison owner guy found out how Robbins' character left the prison.Since 12/31/01, I've seen the movie four more times, bought the screenplay and bought the DVD.10/10"
744,True,"This movie is the best movie around. Tim Robbins plays his character superbly (is that a word??). Morgan Freeman was an awesome choice for Red. At first glance, I thought is was a so-so movie. Then I saw it again, and again. The plot became so intricate; instead of being about Andy and his trying to find the truth, it became about Red and his own internal struggle.Anyway, I recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies of any kind."
745,True,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***
One of my friends raved about this film so I looked it up on IMDB and there it was at no 2 in the top 250 movies with over 42000 people giving it 10 out of 10 so I gave it a try and wished I had watched it years ago.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red both give first class performances and the friendship that develops between them is heartfelt, Especially when you feel that two people of completely different social standings that would not pass the time of day on the outside world bond so well in the confinements of shawshank prison. There is no facetious acting and even the scenes where Andy is violated by the `sisters'  there are no grisly scenes but still the viewer is left in no doubt what took place. some people call it bland but to me it adds to the appeal  of the film and in-keeping with time scale the film was set in.This story appeals on so many levels and I can see why its in the top ten films in IMDB and the tag line It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another completely captures the film essence and I know it will not be 8 years before I watch it again. But having to wait years to watch it I must qualify for the sadster of the year award !!9/10"
746,True,"CONTAINS SPOILERS Review by Joe: `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' the original short novel by legendary author Stephen King, sparked the start of a superb movie and ongoing legend. Andrew Dufresne, a fairly young man committed murder and was sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  There are some elements of this film that differ from elements of this novel.  And yet many things are the same.In the novel, Andy was a short, partially bald man, who was quiet and shy, and in the movie he was a tall intimidating stocky figure.  I think this difference is important in one particular scene: the prisoners are tarring the roof, and Andy overhears Hadley, a man who is angry at the world, talking about his inheritance from his deceased brother.  Andy speaks up about the taxes of the inheritance and Hadley gets furious.  I think that if in the movie he was the man described in the book, it would have made this seem weak, and Hadley probably wouldn't have thought him worthy to even speak to him. I think this movie was put together well, but to be honest, I like Stephen King's short novel better.Review by Steve: The movie was very good.  Andy's life in prison was real.  Andy really got cheated out of 20 years of his life.  Andy's in jail for something he didn't do. I especially like the scene when the warden was talking to the media. When the warden was in front of the building talking it looked like the warden had a crown on.  Showing that he was a king he had all the power. I didn't like the ending of the movie.  It was good for them because it was what they both wanted. They both wanted freedom and that's what that scene showed.  But they should have had some sort of action, like gone sailing, fishing, showed them both out to sea doing something.  Being free.  Not just on the beach hugging each other.Review by Derek: I think that the directors should have filmed the movie in Charleston, Maine because I've spent a lot of time there.  I wish I would have had a chance to see the whole movie but from what I saw it was a great movie. I liked the movie cause it seemed so real.  But what I didn't like was how the guards and the warden thought that any one who got in the way or their business they could kill them or put them in solitary confinement.  Plus I didn't like how guards treated inmates like slaves. They couldn't just face reality and treat them like equals. But it happens in prisons all over the world so that's why I liked Shawshank Redemption.Review by Brad: I liked the movie compared to the book.  I think that the movie was way better. The movie seemed to be way more interesting.  It was complimentary to Stephen King's ways of writing an intricate portrayal of an actual event that took place in Maine. One of the things I liked about the movie is the way camera angles portray power.Review by Dan: A Review of Shawshank Redemption from an Inmate's View I found the movie not nearly as enjoyable as Stephen King's `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'.  The points I found I did not agree with are they have Red's character as a black man in the movie when in the short story he was a white Irish man but it kinda adds a little laughter to a serious theme.  Second they have Andy Dufresne as a tall skinny man when in `Rita Hayworth.' he's a small and a heavy man with not much of an aura. Thirdly they have one warden Mr. Norton when there is three in the short story because it seems to the viewer that 19 years did not go by, but in a way its good so the viewer can focus his hate towards one figure. That's what I didn't like but there are more pros than cons.  The film makers did an excellent job with the lighting, the angle of the camera and the music. With these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as black as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an ocean. With all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 8 ½.Review by Chris: This movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I thought were pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's singing and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music is really fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and really is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters and then finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him because he helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting Phat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool Pretty Killer-same"
747,True,"WARNING:***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE
I originally rented this film because I had read it was an escape movie. That was all I had really heard about it.  The title didn't seem very familiar to me, but I thought I would rent it.  I was slightly worried that I had ruined the ending for myself, but I was worrying for nothing.  From the very first scene the movie had me.  Morgan Freeman's performance was PERFECT.  The music was great.  The plot was surprisingly varied and it pulled me in.  And  of course the escape scene was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen in a movie anywhere.  The plot is so simple.  A man beats the system.  It affects anyone who is human.  If you have disregarded my warning and are reading it without seeing it, don't worry.  I haven't ruined it. This is one movie that has to be experienced.  There is absolutely nothing else I can say.  Those of you have seen it will know what I'm talking about. It seems like I'm at a loss for words, and that's true.  Everyone must see this movie.  If you haven't seen it, stop reading, go out, and rent it or buy it or borrow it or steal it or download it-just see it.  This is worth any rental price.  It sounds simplistic to the point of irrevelence.  It sounds like any other movie.  It sounds boring.  BUT ITS NOT.  It's beautiful!  It's perfect!  My writing skills are usually much better than this, but I can't fit this movie into words.  JUST SEE IT. NOW.  ""Get busy living, or get busy dying..."""
748,True,"***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Imagine me as an old man with a beard sitting on the stoep (porch) waving my cane at people passing by.""How dare you call the Shawshank Redemption an unorginal prison fairytale! It is not supposed to be a run of the mill prison movie. Its not supposed to be The Birdman of Alcatraz! It's not supposed to be MIDNIGHT EXPRESS! It's not even supposed to be Stir Crazy, you wippersnappers! The prison is only the backdrop! It's about overcoming the odds when you are at your rope's end. This is a movie about hope and finding it in the darkest and dreariest of places.""This movie could easily have been set in Nazi Germany in opressed Germany, in a concentration camp, in a 19th century work house! It's about breaking free from things that oppress us needlessly! (Spoiler starts here) Andy is the only person in prison that doesn't belong there! If he had done something bad he would have accepted it, but he didn't, so he tunnels through a wall to freedom. (Spoiler ends here).""Sentimentalism can be bad in a movie if handled incorrectly, but Darabont uses it better than other Capra impersonators out there (even beating the Coens with their Hudsucker Proxy). And there is nothing wrong with sentimentality in The Shawshank Redemption. And I can't see what cliches you are talking about. Just because good things happen doesn't mean they cliches.""This is a meditative movie. It's also has a lot of little things to enjoy for repeat viewing. So get off your high-horse and enjoy this movie.""This is all I have to say.""Get back onto his chair and blows bubbles out of his pipe."
749,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a superb motion picture. The story is great. I love movies like this where you root for the underdog, in this case wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne, skillfully played by Tim Robbins. The cunning of Dufresne is amazing, and the movie throws in a nice moral lesson on the importance of friendship. Also the directing and cinematography are great.  Everyone should see this. bye."
750,True,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I saw the movie for the first time I was a child of 8 years old I guess. I was completely obsessed by this movie. The movie took too much time so my parents didn't allow me to see the end of the movie. I was mad as you can understand ;) Now Im a boy of 16 years old and I saw the movie 8 times. Im a bit of a movie freak, if I have the time for it I watch one every evening. I have seen a lot of movies. But not such good as The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is a perfection. It has a perfect story. The movie is very long, but I have never bored while I was watching. The sound and music are also perfect. When Brooks leaves the prison and sees the daylife again the music is totally perfect. You are going to think about some things you have done in your life. That's the same when Andy escapes and arranges the beers for his friends. Red says about Andy when you him sitting in the sun (when he has arranged the beers) with a little smile on his face: 'I think he did it to feel normal again'. That are lines when you start thinking. And when Red is allowed to leave prison you got a kind of a winner feeling. Then he sees Andy again, that's the perfect end. This movie was not a simple prison breakout. But a movie with the best story I have ever seen. I can say to everyone that you have to see the movie. Im sure you will think the same way as I do. When you see it multiple times you will understand the movie better and better, and I hope you will love then as much as I do!"
751,True,"Many people seem confused why this movie is rated so high by so many.  I am confused how you can walk away from this movie and not think that is one of the greatest movies you have seen.  I am more baffled some people gave it a ""1"" rating.  To each his own I suppose.  For those who don't understand what makes this movie so great I will explain.*SPOILERS* Probably the number one thing about this movie is the acting.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins play the most believable and likeable characters ever.  The movie is like a good hit of ecstacy.  It builds up for so long that you really come to like Andy and hate the warden.  Then before the end he escapes, the warden throws the rock through the wall, the warden kills himself, and finally they are on a beach in Mexico.  All the special effects on earth couldn't give me a rush like the end of this movie.  It just creates this moving emotional feeling inside and you feel as vindicated as you know Andy and Red must feel.Of course there are many other great moments in the middle of the movie. For example, when they get to drink the beer and when the guy passes the test.  I could go on for hours about this movie so I'll stop now."
752,True,"**** SPOILERS HEREIN**** proceed at own risk!!!!!it is simply no wonder that shawshank redemption is as insanely popular as it is. the movie is the greatest flag-bearer for hope and the determination. i have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and recently caught it on television as part of a stephen king horror special series!!!!the movie begins at quite a slow pace and after about half an hour i was wondering why this movie was so highly rated. but slowly the movie unravels and soon i was totally caught up in its brilliance. sometimes harsh, sometimes serene, sometimes wishful, sometimes dreadful. the intensity of the despondence at shawshank prison is almost tangible.tim robbins and morgan freeman are outstanding in their roles. each character is brilliantly etched and is a delight to watch. the screenplay is the highlight of the movie and there is always a feeling of something larger lurking behind the damp grey walls of shawshank.for those who have seen the movie, an interesting point would be that the name of stephen king's novella is ""rita hayworth & the shawshank redemption"". well well!!the movie though has to be watched. it is an experience every human should go through. it takes the light at the end of the tunnel to the next plane.an elevating 10!!"
753,True,"CONTAINS SPOILERS ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film about banker Andy Dufrense(Tim Robbins) who is framed and sent to a maximum security prison for the murder of his wife and her lover.He befriends Red Redding(Morgan Freeman), who is the only guilty man in Shawshank, the prison.  Through a few brutal years, Andy finally manages to get through.  He helps prisoners graduate high school, opens a prison library, and works on the taxes for the crooked warden(Bob Gunton). Little does anybody know what his secret is, an escape.Based on a short story by Stephen King from 'Different Seasons', this is the best film about the triumph of the human spirit.  Frank Daranbot delivers a top notch drama.  This film also features an excellent musical score by Thomas Newman.  Morgan Freeman delivers,in my opinion, his best role.  Though a little cruel at some points, this film will make you want to see it again.  One of the three best films of the 1990s.  Second on my all time list."
754,True,"Like ""Pearl Harbor,"" (AAAHHH!) this film had comedy despite the fact that it was a drama. For example, when Andy is ordered to turn off music that is annoying to the Warden (but not to the rest of the prison... they just listen), Andy turns it up!But, unlike ""Pearl Harbor"" (AAAHHH!), this film actually needed a bit of GOOD laughter, whereas ""PH"" (AAAHHH!) was laughable in itself, with unneccesary BAD comedy.Anyway, I read the novella first and let me tell you, the film (edited-I watched on TNT) has many differences and add-ons. For example, that bit of comedy wasn't in the book (heck, NO comedy was in the book). Also, (spoiler) when Andy has disappeared, the Warden didn't throw his hand-carved chess pieces at the poster-he tore it down. Also, the novella wasn't 100 pages, whereas this movie (on TNT, with commercials and edits) was 3 hours whole!I am STILL deciding on where to put this better-than-most-films-these-days movie on Favorites list. I am tempted to put it near the top (not at the top-there are better films), but somewhere online someone said that it was a middle-movie (an okay one). Another person declined, but after watching again, they agreed. So, I'll put it somewhere in the middle.I liked it very much, but it's not my favorite movie ever, nor the second. Rather... ah, heck, I can't decide right now!Rating: 4.5/6"
755,True,"Spoiler Alert A few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank Redemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the ""institutionalized"" Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the ""bad"" element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be seen by everyone."
756,True,"What a remarkable film this is. I remember the first time I saw it. It was on video, since I was only 11 when it came out, and I sat down, and I had heard that it was a terrific movie, but I had no idea just how truly GREAT this movie is. After the first viewing I knew it was one of my favorites. I've only seen it three times, so as not to wear it out, and each time, I am blown away.Morgan Freeman is already one of my favorite actors, (Along with Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, and Edward Norton) and his performance here is simply the best of his career. His ""Red"" is a weathered man who has lost hope. He's not a ""bad"" man, even though he did kill a man in his youth. Morgan Freeman is calm and collected, yet his on-screen presence is so powerful. We are drawn to him, almost more-so than to Andy because Andy keeps to himself, while Red narrates. This is partly the point, to turn the audience into an inmate. We only know as much as they do about him. He isn't revealed to us directly very much. And we eventually find out why.I love the way the men of this prison use almost a hierarchy and establish their own little kingdom, with the jail, obviously as their castle. I like watching Andy as he strives to be normal, doing whatever he can to get his mind off of the fact that he's in prison. One of the film's best moments comes when Andy makes a deal that allows all of the roof workers to have a beer, and to just sit around, and be carefree for a few minutes. But for others the prison is normal, all they know, their only life. They call it ""institutionalized"" but what it really means is hopeless. And it's a constant battle to keep that from happening. And eventually it seems, that everyone caves in to the fact that they will die at that place.This is unquestionably one of the most powerful and moving films of all time. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) There are four ending sequences that come one after another that move so fluidly and with such grace that I am in awe just thinking about it. 1. Andy's escape and all of the explanation that goes along with it. The long tunnel of crap, Andy's joy in the pond while the rain pours upon him. 2. The day after and everything that happens to the warden and the guard are done brilliantly. 3. Red's parole hearing. At this point he just doesn't give a crap about anything anymore. He talks about his regret, not because he thinks it will get him out, but so that they will know that his punishment is not so much prison as it is wishing he could've made a better decision. Wishing that the young Red would've had guidance. 4. The reunion at the end while Red narrates. The most wonderful lines come when he's on the bus, and we hear his voice over about how he has shrugged off his ""Institutionalization"" and is ready to not know what happens next. This is the absolute perfect tone to end the movie on. What sheer brilliance. It is sad that this film didn't win ANY Oscars. It certainly deserved to."
757,True,"I saw this movie after I saw ""The Green Mile."" I loved ""The Green Mile"" and thought that I should see another prison movie with the same director. Boy was I glad I did.  The one thing I love about this movie is it's wonderful ending. I felt like that was the best thing that could have happened at that time. I loved it.
 The only thing I didn't like was that I felt that the wardon got off easy. He died instantly. In my eyes he should of had to go to prison and live a horrible life. Oh well. This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen and I encourage everyone to see it. I cannot believe that someone would dare give this movie a 1. If you did, please e-mail me so I can thoroughly yell at you.
 Oh, did anyone else notice that the music seemed very similar to the music in ""The Green Mile?"" 10/10"
758,True,"Interpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any disturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time, represents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its message is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this complacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment of authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the life-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown, hope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in life. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation from it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans - that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and a sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene). For Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope. Andy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be expected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an epiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is always to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in all of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent."
759,True,"Tremendously involving drama. In my opinion, the best new movie in the last 10 years or so. My only quibble is that the film deals with prison life in a somewhat unrealistic, non-threatening or idealistic way compared to some prison movies but otherwise it is terrific. The main characters are quite human and engaging. I found myself almost projecting, mentally, into the group as they share their day-to-day experiences in the joint. Also, the film has a happy ending where the good guy succeeds and the bad guy gets his."
760,True,"<<WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS>>I won't argue that this is a really good film. It is. But I've always felt it's been built up a bit too much. It's well-structured, well-paced, and Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, along with all of his co-stars. But it's still something of a modern fairy tale. We never doubt that things will turn out all right in the end for Andy and Red, or that Norton will get his comeuppance. This, combined with a tendency to get cloying, particularly with the opera record and the spunky kid, effectively knocks it out of the running as one of the all-time greats.All this aside, however, it's impact can't be denied either. Frank Darabont may have let his sentimentality go raging out of control on The Green Mile next, but he just enough restraint here to move us almost to tears. And this same emotional black-and-white treatment allows plot points that might have been laughed of in a more cynical film to feel perfectly satisfying. Tell me you didn't raise a fist in triumph when Norton blew his brains out. And regarding sentiment, it certainly wasn't 1994's worst offender. Matching Forrest Gump for saccharine value would tax even Darabont's skills."
761,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the wisest and most touching films I have ever seen.  It tells the tale of the friendship between two convicted murderers: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Many things make this a good film: its genuine depiction of prison life, the wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, the great music from Thomas Newman.  For all of these qualities, The Shawshank Redemption is worth seeing.What makes the film great for me, though, is the way that in its depiction of prison life, the film becomes an existential display of how most of us live our own lives.  ***SPOILER AHEAD***  Throughout the film, we are confronted by how people choose to accept their freedom.  Brooks, the old librarian, who has been in prison for almost his entire life, becomes scared of the freedom he enjoys, and can not take it.  The same fate almost befalls Red, but his redemption comes as he is able to accept the unpredictability of his life, and draw inspiration from Andy.  The film rings absolutely true, I know many people who are too afraid to chase after their own dreams, and would rather stay in a mundane yet predictable and secure job.  ""Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine,"" Red says in the course of the film.  So, I imagine, do many people's lives.  The Shawshank Redemption is about breaking away from the routine, taking risks, and going after your dreams without compromise."
762,True,"SPOILER ALERT This movie--as I just watched it for, say, the 100th time this morning--is just incredible.  It gives me shudders everytime I watch it.  My favorite part is when the jerk realizes how tim robbins gets out.  What mastery!  I then felt true shudders when he scrambles out of the sewage pipe and rips off his shirt.  I can only imagine being thrown in jail, innocently, spending years there, and not only to be set free but get back at the jerk, and have money at the end.  The movie is thought-provoking and intense from beginning to end.  I love Morgan Freeman too.  The movie taught me many lessons, and reminded me that the simple flight of a bird and the blue of an ocean is something not to take for granted.  Freedom is definitely my biggest priority."
763,True,"When it comes to analyzing the true meanings of movies I'm no expert, but this movie really gave me a feel of inner hope and confidence. I mean, put your self in Andy Dufresne's(Tim Robbins) position. If you were in prison for something that not only did you not do but was being accused of murdering someone that you loved and cared for. And you go to prison for what 30? 40 years? and day after day you dig and you dig and you dig, and with what?? a spoon!! I know I would have gone nuts by then. BUT Andy gave hope, and he also gave Red(Morgan Freeman) hope. And I think that was the main aspect of the whole movie. Which is, in no matter what type of circumstances there is always one Andy Dufresne giving hope. Go find yours!!!!I gave this movie a 8/10."
764,True,"I've seen this film and,as I like this kind of movies I decided to comment about it. The main character believes he doesn't deserve the guilt and try during twenty years, to find a way to escape. But the best thing of the film is the friendship that he developed with the other prisoner. A friendship that remained after they got out of the prison. Is really interesting to see this movie and think a little bit in the destiny that our lives can take someday."
765,True,"I first rented this movie because I had heard it was good and because it was there. Through the first half hour, I thought it was entertaining at most, but after the scene where the one man is beaten and nobody cares, I was totally engulfed in this film. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Every action, every word spoken is absolutely perfect. After seeing it half a million times, I can quote it word for word. I still smile with utter joy in the end and get choked up during the scene with Brooks. Frank Darabont is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen, and it is a shame that he has only made a few movies. The music in this movie is also perfect. If you haven't seen this movie, which I am surprised to hear that many people have not, you should rent it immediately. Nevermind, don't just rent it.... buy it. You will not regret it. Ten out of ten! >"
766,True,"First time I saw this, I was blown away. Second time, I was amazed even more. The movie sucks you in and doesn't let you till the awesome end. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as well as Tim Robbins, and the rest of the stellar cast. Hard to believe Morgan started his big screen career 12 years ago. I think if he started acting in Hollywood when he was 20 instead of 50, he would have quite a few Oscars under his belt.Why does this film get better and better? Probably because you can find new things in each viewing. Knowing what will happen allows you to look around and check out the surroundings. You can see little things that contribute to understanding the story better.SPOILER ALERT!The best part? The very end when Andy Dufresne escapes and shows that with determination, that a person can do anything they want including getting away from a prison after digging a hole in the wall for 19 years.SPOILER END!Overall, this movie is one of the best of all time. Now I will go back to anticipating The Green Mile with Frank Darabont directing and starring Tom Hanks."
767,True,"I was inflicted The Shawshank Redemption in a school trip coach, where a shy girl handed the tape to the headteacher : ""Sir please sir ! Can we watch it ?"". And we did, gosh, we did.  And heard it as well. Spoilers ahead ! A very noisy film - overblown, cheesy, sappy, with ugly slow-motions to make you understand that, hurray, at last the characters are free (and so was I, mercifully), and the bad ones have been punished (and so was I, and so was I...) Yes, at last that does make sense... Next the students asked for Meet the parents - and - would you believe it ? Ben Stiller WAS a relief. Since that moment I've always wanted to watch Zoolander."
768,True,Spoiler!! How can an overglorified view of prison be so widely accepted. I thought we as a movie going audience had got over the romance of films such as escape from alcatraz. Its the same film. Shy white guy befriends black guy. White guy escapes. Black guy is happy. Everyone who voted high for this should watch Animal Factory by Steve Buscemi. It isnt a great film but it offers a far more powerful realistic look into penitentiary life than Shawshank. kev
769,True,"This and the Fight Club and two of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. Sure this is nice- got lots of nice talk, nice interracial bonding in a prison, lots of sub stories about a crappy Warden etc. Sure its got a plan to get out, plan that ultimately fruitions but come on- people talk like this is Jesus's Second Coming or whatever. This is cliché driven drivel of the highest order. Spend your 2 hours elsewhere."
770,True,"The scene where Tim Robbins crawls through 2 football fields of shits sums up what watching this movie feels like. The fact that this movie is top of the IMDb top 250 list is a sign that people on this site have no concept of good film making outside of the standard Hollywood fare. The movie may well be enjoyable, but in the end it is no more than that, enjoyable, and that is pushing it. The director's involvement with other movies outside of this speak volumes: Green Mile is in a similar mould,whilst The Mist shows his continued obsession with Stephen King. With writing credits on over five different mutations of Young Indiana Jones's, his incompetence is evident. At the end of the day, a Hollywood remake by M. Night Shyamalan of this would probably be more satisfying, and that's saying something."
771,True,"After seeing how high it was on 'best film' lists I thought it must be something great, unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Sure, it was a touching story, great actors and of course a great ending, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Shawshank Redemption was visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without reaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the plot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of him meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife? ...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again just for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all. But I still can't get my head round why anybody would consider this 'the best film of all time' because it most certainly isn't."
772,True,"This is supposed to be better than every movie but The Godfather? Well, maybe I could think more positively about it without such ridiculous comparisons, but this is an average movie at best. I guess my biggest problem with it is that it is so completely far-fetched. You have a few characters supplied solely to provide the ""sad"" moments, and everything else is just built up to provide a fulfilling and completely happy ending. Now I'm no prison warden, but I would look behind my tenant's posters (more in case they've tunneled into each other's rooms for a little lights-out action).Anyway, as I thought about it more, the movie started to remind me of another classic prison flick, Cool Hand Luke. Unfortunately for Shawshank, Tim Robbins is no Paul Newman, and whatever stiff played the warden is no Struther Martin. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the way in which Cool Hand Luke presents a much more believable series of events, with no fairy tale ending. Luke's omission of the whole prison-love thing is even forgivable thanks to the inclusion of a classic car wash scene. One does not need a prisoner who happened to be roommates with a prisoner who happened to kill the wife of a man who happens to be a prisoner to create drama. It's a truth Shawshank dearly needs to learn."
773,True,"I'd heard so much about this film, everyone who told me about it, sang its praises. My ex boyfriend said he'd cried at the end. It's even ranked #2 in imdb's top 250 movies. So you can imagine that as I settled down to watch this film, I was expecting something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately for me, it was *very* ordinary. Ok sure, there's some great twists and some parts keep you on the edge of your seat. But the pace was slow and dragged in parts, *SPOILER* just like Andy's possesions when he escapes. A few rare films I've watched, American Beauty for example, have made me go ""wow"" afterwards and stayed with me long after the film has finished. Due to all the hype, I was expecting to feel the same after watching ""Shawshank"" but all I feel is that most of the film is instantly forgettable and cheesy. I suspect that most of the people who have rated this film a 9 or 10 haven't had the opportunity to see many films that haven't had the ""Hollywood"" conveyor belt behind them. My advice to them is to give smaller, low budget films a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised."
774,True,"Once again, another year (or Christmas) goes by and this movie is thrust onto the television screen for all to enjoy. And what an enjoyable movie it is - as I've seen it countless times now.The major theme that runs throughout this film is hope. The main character Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is the one who shines a beacon of hope like an Olympic athlete carrying the torch to the cauldron, and this starts from time he enters Shawshank prison. The other main character, Red, played by Morgan Freeman, said he took to liking him from the beginning as ""he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start."" And Andy even inspires Red to ""hope"" for a life outside of the prison walls and to join him in a free life on a Mexican beach by the Pacific sea.And the theme of hope is also enforced by a darker side. The prison librarian, Brooks, played by James Whitmore, who has been a resident for 50 years, is given parole and leaves prison to ""enter"" life outside of the four walls. And upon realising that he can't come to terms with the pace of life and no family or friends to turn to, he loses hope, and ends his life. I think that this theme is the magic that most people like about this movie. It's the glue that joins the friendship between Andy and Red. And its the thing that viewers, like me, can relate our life and experiences to.Even after so many viewings I still feel that this movie is powerful and a revelation to pretty much every person. Its pretty much a powerful contemporary tale of a Biblical story. A story about hope, friendship, loss, betrayal, contempt (particularly what the antagonist prison warden Norton brings), brutality, injustice, crime and so forth.I think that this movie deserves to be played on a yearly basis, particularly on Christmas day. It's a modern day retelling of a Biblical story. I believe everyone should see this movie at least once."
775,True,"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story  the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the ""best film of all time"" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever."
776,True,"If you wonder if there is a perfect movie, then don't, cause this is the ultimate movie that we as humans can do .And yes there is a few other movies that are perfect . I don't think if there is anyone hate this movie, simply because it hits on a multiple nerves 😊 .Spoilers .. spoilers.. spoilers..""There are places in this world that aren't made out of stone.

777,True,"When i didn't saw this movie, i thought it'd be cool as IMDb top rated movie. But i don't think to be this movie IMDb top rated. It's nothing but different than a prison break story. Actually, there's some inspirational quotes in this. movie what led it to be top. But i didn't find it much cool.But i loved some of it's part. The corruption of the govt. people make me amazed.The acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were appreciated. I only got a message from the movie is there's still hope until my death. As much hard as you can, you'll be able to grab your success. It happens in our real life. It was a good thing that patients can give you every thing you want in your life. You just need to get stuck with it until you get it."
778,True,"Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't get how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.This movie just doesn't work."
779,True,"SR is a good film. In my view it is not a great film! Firstly - it is lazy film-making to have a character (Red, in this case, played by Morgan Freeman) as a narrator to tell us what is happening. The film itself should convey the narrative. If someone has to read the narrative I might as well just buy the book!Secondly - the story is simply not believable! I can't believe that a prisoner gets to do all the tax returns for the guards and governor. I can't believe that a prisoner entering the prison just happens to have a heard another prisoner in another prison boast about committing the murder for which our hero is serving time. Thirdly - the story all ends up 'happy ever after' which is seldom the case but which, I suppose, satisfies those of a simplistic/idealistic nature. I prefer more grit and realism.Fourthly - the 'goodies' (Dufresne, Red, Brooks) and the 'baddies' (Bogs, Hadley, Norton) are drawn so simplistically they might as well have been wearing white and black hats! There is no depth of character here.Fifthly - and most damning - this film made me feel very little! I didn't really care about the characters (except - maybe - Red). The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me. I go to the cinema to be moved by the plot or the characters; to be made to think; or simply to laugh! This was not a laughing film but neither did it reach me on any other level.It was also too long!"
780,True,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
781,True,"This movie was amazing story, it takes us look at the other side of prisoners in prisons and how they feel when they return to society. Many people are ignore how they feel when back to society. There are so many thing we can learn in this movie. For the fans of Morgan Freeman, he did a ggrat job in this movie and other actor is very good also. Moreover,the film tells us that the truth will always win, although it requires a long time. Many things are not unexpected from this film. So for those who are bored with films that have a simple story, this might be a recommendation for you. You must focus to the movie when you watching it to get the meaning of the story. The story is very slick and classy."
782,True,this movie though not a blockbuster during its initial release has become a favorite for every movie-buffs because of the following reasons 1.morgan freeman in his most carrier defining role. 2.tim robins as 'mr.dufresne' portrays a man who did nothing as harmful as a crime. 3.background score makes you feel for the protagonist. 4.that beautiful picture of Rita Hayworth. 5.the brilliant example of what time and pressure can do. 6.In prison also there is corruption 7.The friendship between the two main characters is beautiful 8.Redemption may not the only thing to survive. 9.continuous effect will lead to the thing we want. 10.After all it is a crowd favorite
783,True,"what an awesome movie it is? Worth watching it. All time favorites... Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title. Because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."
784,True,"It's a rhythm that is well thought out. When we look at the same actors, it is easy to forget the time span of the film for more than 20 years. Such a great measure in reality, time will be too slow, will only be amplified in prison. It's not like the movie is not interested in these moments. Still know, this is just a plan in the sweet time to get there. In return, the monotonous life of prison makes it more exciting. It seems that this is a moment that will never be forgotten.

785,True,"When this movie was released it was a ""flop"" in the cinemas. That doesn't stop it from being the best movie of all time. In the start it is just getting into the story. It is dramatic. Then the story gets into the prison, where Andy finds it hard to fit in. He then befriends Red, Morgan Freeman. As they bond Andy imports various tools to help him to, spoilers, escape from prison. If we go back a bit we get to the saddest bit in the movie. When, spoilers, Brooks dies. He had a bird called Jake at the prison that he let free. When he got his parole, he went to work for a grocery store. The problem was, he had been in prison for too long. He didn't remember how to live in a world outside the prison. One day, he couldn't take it anymore. he carved into the wall ""Brooks was here"" and hung himself at the spot.After Andy escaped from the prison, he let Red know where he was headed. When Red got his parole, he went to follow where Andy was. It was a long journey, but he made it. It ended at a scene where Andy was working on a boat and Red walking up to him.To sum up, this deserves to be the most liked movie all time. It wouldn't be up there in the best movie of all time with movies such as The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Apocalypse Now. Apart from that, it is my favourite movie of all time, over all of those movies."
786,True,"An amazing piece of film. Penned by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, this one sneaks up on you, takes you to the lowest place of the human spirit then takes you in the exact opposite direction. Totally snubbed by the Oscars, but one of the greatest films of all time. Told in the narrative style, conducted by Morgan Freeman, we get a picture of the prison system of the 1940s-1960s and some of the wildly unique characters who inhabit the walls of Shawshank Prison. Shawshank, is a frequent and oft referenced institution of many of Stephen King's stories (both written and on screen) and every time i hear the name in any of his works it makes me think of this story."
787,True,"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"
788,True,"in my opinion this movie will never be old fashion always has something new for people.great performances of actors and wonderful story make this movie one of my best.I am not able to forget i can't compare this movie with another movies never and never Ne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks."
789,True,"for those who like to watch prison life style and how every friend counts in that situation. A wholesome package of Entertainment. yes the time line of this movies seems to move forward slowly many times but every time a heart touching conversation makes it worthy again. At least one time must see the movie of course if you have time and you like this kind of movies . this movie is about how a person can get in prison because of a silly decision and how rough prison life can be. obviously in that case making friend is not an easy task , but making enemy is a pretty easy one but the result of that is not a pretty one.then again this movie is about how a man lives in this kind of a situation and how he makes friends , how he takes care of his conscious and above all how he survives this ....."
790,True,"This Movie is one of the best Movies i watched.Tim Robins leads a Great Character as Andy Dufrense.He is Amazing Through out all the Movie.Although his friend Ellis Boyd(Morgan Freeman) have best lead character.He helps him to escape from the Prison. The movie is about how a Innocent Man got to Prison.When He realize that he is innocent he planing to escape from that prison.There is no action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him"
791,True,"Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."
792,True,"Pain, death, love and hate have never been personified the beautifully on screen. Storyline, story-arc and character-arc are alive and well in the creative light of this picture. A welcomed reminder of good triumphing over not just evil, but the time good needs to find it's foundation, grow, live and learn under evils presences to survive. Quoting fellow IMDb member Tim Cox ""One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie.

793,True,"This movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few can compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison for murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red soon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate factory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way that the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the other officers about it, including Warden Norton and Andy is soon doing tax returns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for Andy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the prison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life on the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton tries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a new prisoner named Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and reveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to bring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has Hadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had enough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a tunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from solitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton and Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand kills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like Brooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in Mexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film is great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy and Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the issue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large portion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become adapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside world. Overall it's just a great movie so I hugely recommend it."
794,True,"This movie is simply amazing, no doubt about it. I found it moving yet funny in parts and it brought a tear to my eye. I would really recommend this movie to anyone because each person I have recommended it to has enjoyed it immensely and begs to watch it again. The ending is one that is very shocking but it all makes sense, making you want to watch it again to see how the ending could end in this way. Red was a favourite character of mine, not just because he was played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, but also because this character brought humor to the story with a slight sad twist towards the end. I loved this movie and it will remain one of my favourites for a long time."
795,True,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story is not that original, I've seen other movies with a similar story. It's the way the movie is portrayed that makes this movie a masterpiece. The cast is great and you really feel with Andy the whole time.In the beginning Andy really had bad luck. To have your wife being killed at the moment you found out she had an affair. It's was also really unfortunate that he was near the crime scene with a gun. He seemed guilty. His first years in the prison were also very hard for Andy. At the moment he's doing better, I felt better. Then the story continues to have an unexpected turn. The better Andy's life was going, the better I was feeling. I was very glad to see there was justice in the end.After you finish watching this movie, you feel really good. You feel like you've went through an incredible journey and it all ended well. I would recommend anyone I know to watch this movie as soon as possible."
796,True,"I have just finished watching this movie. It is amazingI really did not think it was going to be this good. After hearing so many great reviews from friends and relatives alike, I've finally decided to watch it. I love it.The story is amazing the main character Andrew is a pure genius. He manages to build a library in the prison, do taxes for prisoners, guards, and warden alike, comes with perfect escape plan, and exploits Warden's corruption, fakes his identity, and finally gives a gift to his friend Red.I thought the performance were amazing too. Morgan Freeman is just amazing at every act he does. Other actors were pretty damn good as wellwell-deserving 10 out of 10"
797,True,"I was born in the 90's so I did not grow up watching The Shawshank Redemption. 2 years ago or so I decided to watch it. I was blown away. It moved me in a way that few other movies have. It is a masterpiece. Imagine if your life was taken away from you and all you had was your thoughts about what you did, what you have done, or what you were going to do. Wouldn't it drive you nuts, wouldn't it make you want to give up hope in life. That is the key word in this film, ""hope"". When Andy suffers during that whole time he is at Shawshank prison, you feel for him yet you keep thinking that it will end bad for him and his friend Red. As their relationship grows, Andy's plan to escape grows and soon he fines hope that he will escape that God awful place, and then he does and you cant help but to ball your eyes out after realizing what this man had to do to reach his goal. And then the last scene with Andy and Red symbolizes that this film is for the weak who strive to be strong. The writing, acting, directing, cinematography all make this one of the greatest films of all time."
798,True,"I have often wondered, before seeing this film,how on Earth in became the No.1 rated film on IMDb. I felt it was certainly overrated as there were some masterpiece films that I believed deserved a higher rating, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather Parts I and II as well as other classics like the first Matrix.However, I finally watched the film and I was completely stunned. I just never expected the film to contain so much emotion and so little of worthless action. This film is one of the best films ever made and I believe it certainly does deserve a No.1 ranking on IMDb.The acting in this film is just superb, especially by Morgan Freeman. I mean, this legend, is in some of the best films ever made like Shawshank Redemption, Se7en and the Dark Knight. Morgan Freeman is simply unbelievable in this film and the relationship between his character, Red and Andy was just superbly filmed. It actually gave me tears****SPOILERS****When Brooks was finally released from Shawshank, he realises the outside world is too much for him and commits suicide. This scene was just so sad it left me crying. The same when Red was released, I again started crying. The scene were Norton kills himself was totally surprising and a shock to me, realizing that Andy had truly defeated him and there was nothing for him to live for.The ending scene where Red and Andy reunite after all those days, or years, was just breathtaking and I was glad the film ended the way it did. I've heard people complaining about the ending, saying that it was too long and extended, but I strongly believe this ending worked perfectly well.****END OF SPOILERS****Overall, if anyone hasn't seen this film I'll tell you know....GO WATCH THE FILM....You won't regret it."
799,True,"Everyone says the shawshank redemption is one of the best films made but i can't disagree. Everything about it makes it the film it is the sound , setting and the narrating by Morgan freeman. The film is a crime drama and we understand at the start of the film that Andy dufrense is a intelligent man and seems very quite at the beginning of the film, he seems a though he thinks a lot.We then get to understand Andy better when he becomes close friends with red who is has been at shawshank for many years. we are then shown as a spectator Andy experience in shawshank from fighting of the rapists which then ends up with the main one getting transferred to then helping out Hadley with his financial issues to then becoming a friend of warden Norton. however this all changes when Andy finds out the warden can help him to get out of shawshank because he can prove he is innocent but the warden refuses to do this which turns out to be a big mistake for him as we come to see one of the best scenes of movie when we find out Andy had escaped from shawshank but not only doing that giving the FBI all the corrupt documents that Norton was involved in which then leads to the FBI coming to arrest Norton.we then see red walking along the beach and smiles at Andy as he is walking up to him.It's not just the story than makes this a great film. the sound which was used in the film made it even better the music used was just right for each scene and was one of the best parts about the film also. if you haven't watch the shawshank redemption yet i would recommend it."
800,True,"As of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty on the ""IMDB Top 250"" list with 731,886 ratings averaging at about 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more critical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a ""fresh"" rating, the film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring these two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is ranked. Here's a film that holds the ""IMDB Top 250"" list by a long shot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking ""the best movie of all time."" Of course, being on the ""IMDB Top 250"" doesn't qualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more respectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and stronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one looks further down the ""Top 250"" list, you'll see a number of questionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story 3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the highest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a wonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's self worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with characters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous lifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare amount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a novella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is psychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has focused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his long career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in 1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his cheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy assures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as a con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his asking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy, betting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night in prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and hell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and eventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become understanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to the man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of mistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but he eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden Samuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized performance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do odd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly, respect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards, policemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a time where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just for bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for the feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard tells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state government won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter every week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism, self worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its identity; ""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free."" There is a character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison trustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits suicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any sort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for anyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because he has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually teaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time, which I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will seem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along. How mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small rooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your corporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes prisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is true, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never look past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think about what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad people. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard on this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is immersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching, light cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions throughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way, and rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more reason, its placement on the ""Top 250"" really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by: Frank Darabont."
801,True,"This film is one of the few remaining masterpieces that hasn't needed, nor will need to suffer the indignity of a poor remake.All throughout the film you feel truly connected to Andy & Red. From the trial in court, getting off the bus, through to Red finally getting his parole at the end.The genius of the tunnelling through the walls, covering them with a poster, to the ingenuity of swapping the books and shoes over with the incompetent warden.Very well directed, amazing actor's at their best.Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good film."
802,True,"Shank's a layman's classic. Talk to friends and family and the name comes up as a favorite. The film has a tight structure and a nice rise in tension, and we like the cast of characters. But what makes this a favorite is a gimmick. At the finish-line of the film we feel that rise of exhilaration where all is made equal. The antagonists meet their ends and the heroes escape unscathed. The entire structure of the film moves us and captivates us...Andy, the perfect victim, faces guiltless punishment with little complaint and furrowed hope. Freeman's character smiles in his wise way as counts the weeks he knows he deserves. The film's theme of hope becomes apparent early on, and is not distinct from other 90s dramas. Even so, it works with the film's tensions and transfers that hope to the viewer in an unusually effective way. Sure, its 90s sentimentality, and its not great cinema. But its like a potent glass of wine, and can take our minds off our own problems and drop us into that ever-circling illusion of hope that spurts from arts of this sort."
803,True,"This movie beyond doubt the best movie I've ever seen.. The plot , the acting , the setting are just amazing. Having said that I do have some negative comments. No , negative isn't the word , perhaps just my opinion on some parts of the film that could have been done better.The first thing that comes to mind is that I thought some bits were a little too predictable. At some points during the movie I guessed what they were going to say and I was right on the money. I didn't get just get the same idea I mean I guessed word for word what they were saying.The second thing that bothered me a little was the ending. I don't want to give anything away but the way 'Red' found it so quickly , I mean of all the fields and brick walls in Bruxton, also the way he found Andy on the beach was just ... I donno I guess I was a little disappointed but I guess they had to make the ending like it is , the film is long as it is ( eh , I guess I'll have to check the spoilers little square thing now ).But hey , who am I to judge.Well I guess that about sums it on the negative points that I thought this film had. I'm not going to state any good points because I'll be here for weeks."
804,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by Stephen King. Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover. Inside, he befriends Red (Freeman), another inmate, and keeps making changes around the place, which worries the prison warden.I watched the film when I found out that it had beat ""The Godfather"" to the top position on IMDb's Top 250 movies list. It was great, but I don't quite think it deserves the Nr 1 position. Don't get me wrong, the film is more than worth watching, but there's a lot of movies out there, just as good as this one and there's nothing outstandingly special about this one. It's great, nonetheless, and I can strongly recommend it.9/10"
805,True,"The Shawshank Redemption (1994) I've seen this film in its entirety now. Initially, I was afraid it would be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have very little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy but it was a film that lost that year to ""Forest Gump"". Its release on VHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film frequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study as a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen King ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" it tells the story of wealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end of the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a notorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline is provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison guards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish conditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight/hetero prisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its theme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond between Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most poignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners have lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with prison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the prison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with the real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is extremely depressing. The ""bad guys"" turn out to be not the criminals who attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel Warden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to knowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too bent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy in prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by humor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such power and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet ""Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm album with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so touching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when the investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise of the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with excellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a classic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled."
806,True,"Yes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful and moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can forget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human faith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to remain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all about.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should be proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and desire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A moving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real credit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne whose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis 'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed from guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and sorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth sympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a magical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and that is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet each other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It is a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar although it had 7 nominations.А real unfairness cause this movie is indeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that Shawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10 greatest films of all time."
807,True,"The shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to watch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever made by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this masterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and another nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful imprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an unbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank prison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect, the murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE befriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their problems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these factors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned themselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is released soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied nothing."
808,True,"This film was so deep. Suicide, murder, innocence, friendship and of course hope.I watched only a bit of this film at one point and thought its alright. But i looked at its rating being no.2 and thought ""really"". I was then desperate to see what makes this film the top of the nineties. Watched it with my family and it simply blew me away. The way it was sad was happy just realising that Andy difference (who was arrested for murdering his wife and her lover when drunk) was all this time innocent after spending 19 years in shawshank prison. its the police that show who are the good guys but in this its the other way round and the way it was done was exciting and intelegant.The scripts was fantastic, the acting was sensational and most of all the story was one the best ever explained in a film (infact the best ever).we all have our opinions but if you think this film is rubbish for no specific reason then there is something wrong with you."
809,True,"This is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this as the second best film of all time behind ""The Godfather"".It can arguably be the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and inspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the Shawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is hope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a story of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart despite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it is full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a thousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and redemption."
810,True,"I saw this movie mainly because it was rated so highly in IMDb. It was a decent movie but it should not be number 2. It has Morgan Freeman and his wonderful voice so that's certainly a plus. The messages of the bad guys getting it in the end is nice as well as keeping one's hope alive in adverse circumstances. I didn't really think the gestapo like guard, who is able to kill anyone on a whim, was very believable. Even convicted felons have loved ones who would want answers. Besides, guards know that one day the tables may be turned on them and this usually tempers their cruelty. Vicious guards are usually ""dealt with"" by the inmates, so I don't believe a guard like this could last long, and certainly not over 20 years. And how is it that the warden and chief guard are in the same job at the same prison for over 20 years? I don't really buy the massive kickbacks the warden was getting continuously either. Prison labor in the USA usually involve trash picking, farming & soap making for institutional use and license plate stamping. These are not highly profitable industries. Neither was I too thrilled by the subtle cynicism aimed at the Bible and those who read it. Lots of convicts ""get religion"" and it is generally a good thing. Also, the quick series of mini-scenes leading me by the hand through the resolution (baptism by sewage, screaming headlines, screaming sirens, arrests and suicide) seemed fairytale like. At least you can say that the movie raises awareness of the fact that there are wrongly convicted people in prison and that savage inmates beat and rape each other. I did like the demeanor of the main character, Andy, our victim cum hero. A mix of being quiet, brooding, deliberate, cautious, willful, sly and subdued. This is a nobler hero than what you see in many Hollywood movies. And Morgan's performance as Red reminds us that, felon or not, inmates are still quite capable of humanity. So in general, I didn't mind watching this movie. It entertained me. I just wouldn't include it in my list of best movies. I would not want to watch it again."
811,True,"After just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can be called a ""moden classic"". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim""The Mystic River"" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called ""The Sisters"".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan""The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven""Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank""The Green Mile"" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80!"
812,True,"This is by no means a bad movie, but it's certainly not as great as many people claim. I have watched it a couple of times already now and I just don't see what's so brilliant about it. The story is good, but not excellent. The acting of the biggest part of the cast is good, but I really can't identify myself with Andy, the main character. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while being innocent. Though, he just doesn't do it for me. You would expect me to feel sympathy for him, because of his situation. To a certain degree I do of course, as I do with anyone who is done injustice. But that is not enough, that's why I think this movie is overrated."
813,True,"One of the most satisfying movies ever. Anyone who has seen this film is being gradually overwhelmed by the injustice towards a single man; and while the scenario unfolds a grim, but also an unpredictable future, the hero reveals at the end his so far unrealistic stance in everything inside the prison. Redemption is not a utopia on this film. A scarce thing to see in the majority of today's movies. It perfectly reflects an every day person's point of view in assessing things and his life by ""get busy living or get busy dying"". And although it contains some dramatic characters, it gives the final sensation to the audience that hope can really change things, no matter the costs involved. A sensation that is amiss from today's movies, which try to present a realistic ending or character. Movies were not made to be totally realistic and this movie proves it magically."
814,True,"First of all i enjoyed this film immensely. It was well shot, highly emotive and contained two great lead performances, but the fact remains that this movie is perhaps too overrated in the grand scheme of cinema.It must not be forgotten that this film is an adaptation of a short story and as such the narrative requires a little more depth. One should also take into account the film's cult status as a sleeper hit (which never the less underlines its definite quality) as reason to be cynical over its actual significance in American popular cinema.However, the film is undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the prison genre, certainly ranking alongside the likes of Cool Hand Luke. The relationship of the main protagonists is perhaps one of the reasons for this as is the movies themes and contextual references. As a result this is a fine picture which inspires its audience to question justice and honour in a non too clichéd way."
815,True,"I can't believe I waited 11 years to see this film. I often saw commercials advertising the film on TNT, but never had enough interest to sit and watch until I bought the movie for my fiancée. I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the actors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have never seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than any other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim Robbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and never dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is incredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a half hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler, who showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die Hard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring at the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape from Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the sewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie managed to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another unrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though I thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of Shawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible acting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com scale."
816,True,"Well... this is the cat out of the bag. Pandora's box opening. Why did I ever find a critique site. I'm one of the most opinionated stubborn sh...uhh so and so's.... in the world.So I guess first and foremost did I like it. No!..........Just kidding. How can you fail to? Its my favourite movie of all time. It has just occurred to me that this may be my first ever sober critique of the film. It's one of those movies confined to the small, smokey, pokey corners of a pub when the issue of greatest film of all time comes up. There's always a 'goodfellas' and a 'Godfather trilogy' and an 'Empire Strikes back' 'Labyrinyth' (?) Voice in the crowd ,(I mix in strange circles) But its fairly unanimous, everyone likes this film. So why?Where do I start. Morgan Freeman...Goes without saying. Tim Robbins...Not sure anyone else could play Dufresne now. Bob Gunton....Born to play evil. William sadler...Under-rated.But it's not really the actors or the Director/photography etc. It's the script. Beautifully constructed. It flows like liquid perfection. Morgan Freeman's VO helps no end. (Brad Pitt described it in 'Se7en' commentry as the voice of god).I had the fortune to watch this before the hype. I got it out on video the day it came out cause I was a fan of Morgan Freeman. I sat there in silence for fifteen minutes after the final credit had scrolled past my screen. It's that good. Breathtaking. (spoiler) When Red wanders across that beach and we see Dufresne there, and the camera slowly pans upwards and away, you know you've been part of something special. I'm not a fan of sickly sweet 'hollywoodised' endings but every now and then they get it right.I should stop now cause I could go on for ever. (The 'record' scene, Brook's parole, the 'beers on the roof', the 'poster', the 'salvation comes from within' rock hammer).I better stop there. Need to take a tablet. See thats why they shouldn't make movies this good.Yeah I quite liked it then.Don't mind and comments/critique/feedback. The e-mails there."
817,True,"This film offers pretty visuals, good-acting and an interesting screenplay.
But it´s a movie very overrated among IMDB users, who put it at the 2th place on best movies list.The explanation is simple the old ""fight for your dreams"", ""never give up"" motive, which thrills and delight audiences.
SPOILERS AHEAD For me, the movie doesn´t work in this way. At the end, the protagonist is old, he had been raped, bitten, etc. The final doesn´t work for me in a full happy end, the main time of his life has already gone!"
818,True,"This movie was an incredible disappointment. I came into watching this movie looking for some deep introspective storytelling, and all I got was a pile of steaming feces. Now one major disappointment (spoilers ahead), was that the characters didn't make ANY fart jokes. Not even once! Now you may call this childish, but I believe that fart jokes are the pinnacle of introspective, existential comedy that really elevates the themes of a plot to another level. Instead, all the jokes fell flat and didn't really make me think about the deep universal consequences of flatulence. Another major complaint was the cast. Yes, I know this is something I cannot change, but I believe the cast would have much better if instead of Morgan Freeman, they cast incredible method actor Dylan Sprouse as Red. I believe Mr. Sprouse would have taken the character of Red to the next level instead of the flat, one dimensional character that Mr. Freeman ""acted"" as (if you would call that acting). The one high point in this movie was the large amount of diversity. I was really happy seeing an Asian, lesbian character as the main character. That kind of diversity is what Hollywood needs. My only wish is that she would be played by a more versatile actor, like Jared Leto or Ashely Tisdale. Overall, this was a disappointment of a movie, and really did not merit the awards it got."
819,True,"I did not see a ""goof"" submission area, so I feel compelled to comment on this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his escape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There in lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted, with his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to where it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that even the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never moved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area that was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which would have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and taping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would have had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's access off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as if Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled pipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have the section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to fit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to get through the pipe. The director would have been better off installing a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks spectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before the bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes and the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily changed in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was packing a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit to a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish he would pack for me on my trips!""Redemption"" is a good movie, but not a great one."
820,True,"If this was the Wizrd of Oz or Bambi then I could understand the appeal of the movie and would rate it accordingly but what this movie is I just do not know and no one can seem to tell me when I ask so why it is considered such a great movie other than: ""Aww it was nice"". Well so are kitten videos on Youtube but should they be in the top spot of greatest movies ever made?Firstly its subject matter is crime and punishment. This is not a genre exempt from theatrical treatment, in musicals and such, but at least you know you are watching a fictitious romantic fantasy when the prisoners break out in song. There is no such device in Shawshank and here lies my problem with this movie. It simply does not in any way indicate that this is fantasy which it quite clearly is. It takes itself seriously and if you examine it seriously then it has serious flaws of deliberate making. If these were accidental then I could possibly forgive them but the fact is the audience is being manipulated like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. For those of you who do not remember it was one of the many tear-jerking TV shows in the 70s with Michael Landon (Lord have mercy on him). It is not that I am against tear-jerkers as such. I cried at the end of The Champ, like most. I can take my portion of treacle in measured doses. It is not that Shawshank is just sentimental. It is the fact that it masquerades as something else. To be fair this is not the fault of the actors. It is technically a very well made movie. The performances are very strong so I can understand its appeal on this level. However, even these positives do not mitigate the sins of the writer. I am a fan of Stephen King and I do enjoy his stories but this is definitely not one of them. Maybe it is because it is not all his doing. I never read the novella so I am not sure how much is his and how much came from the director/writer.There were many little stabs of: ""Is this for real?"" moments in this movie but the scene that really ended my engagement was the scene where Morgan Freedman is telling the other prisoners about institutionalization. This is done to the backdrop of a paroled prisoner hanging himself. The idea of Institutionalisation as a bad thing became popular in the 1990s when this movie was made and and it was simply inserted, like so many ideas lying about without any research or care for its accuracy. The fact we have an uneducated prisoner espousing a theory that had not even been researched just threw back the curtain on the manipulator of Oz and lost me forever. The fact that suicide was used as a sentimental tool to engage the viewer in such a sham and poorly considered way is simply unforgivable in my estimation.Good fiction is meant to engage and to some extent manipulate the audience but it should be believable and due care and consideration should be taken in the treatment and presentation of the story. When you feel the hand of the manipulator, or see the strings holding up the illusion then the spell is broken and the magic is gone. A great movie should have great acting, great production, great direction and writing. This one definitely does not have great writing. This movie is not what it aspires to be. I am not even sure that it knows what it is aspiring to be. It is not serious, not realistic but at the same time does not portray itself as fantasy. So what is it supposed to be and why do people rate it so highly? I have nothing against it but to think it is considered so great when it clearly is not is an insult to all the great writers. As a schmaltzy Sunday afternoon feel-good watch it could be considered good but Great? Come on! This Movie is a non event, at best. It is is a study in form with no substance. A pretty picture of a sentimental scene that never occurred and never will. A fantasy pretending it is something else. What, I just do not know. Can anyone tell me?"
821,True,"i pretty much hated this movie. its a prison movie, so plot is basically Tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes. Morgan freeman is locked up and i don't know he just acts like a kid in this. i understand he's suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really he's giving the same performance here as his role as god in Bruce almighty. even though he's miscast he honestly carries the movie, mainly because Tim robins does nothing in this movie. some other subplots include Tim teaching some idiot to read or something, some old guy hangs himself, they deck a roof,freeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces, i'll stop the the point i'm making is this movie is excruciatingly boring. number one on IMDb, are you kidding me? even from a technical standpoint this movie blows. everything is just dull and unimpressive, hell it looks more like a TV movie than a film. i'd describe the tone of this as Disney's take on jail movies. it's to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life. everyone's favorite part of this is the ending, and that sucked too. Tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer, after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years. his hiding place is a poster? really? to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience. Morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges, than he goes to a rock in some random place that Tim told him to visit, and than goes to Mexico and finds Tim on a boat. reunited and roll credits, oh yeah Morgan freeman also married his step- granddaughter. that's the dumbest ending ever written. there's so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki-oh."
822,True,"When i first saw this I came away thinking it was an entertaining piece of movie making but nothing particularly special. I simply cannot understand why it features so highly in many top movie listings. Yes the story is good and has a nice happy ending. Andy is a character who is easy to identify with against the nefarious, sadistic warden. This unchallenging hackneyed dichotomy is helped by Andy's buddies vs the nasty gang who's leader is intent on a slightly different kind of relationship with Andy.The actors all shine and it's well photographed but is simply nothing special, it certainly doesn't warrant it's apparent stellar position in film history. I think it is the most overrated film of all time, no question. It isn't even a standout in it's own genre and is way way too long in it's telling of a tale that is unoriginal and intellectually undemanding ."
823,True,"I still cannot understand this films continued high regard. Yes, it's a good drama and the acting is pretty solid if unspectacular. But it is the most sickly saccharine and clichéd movie I have ever scene, which often throws logic straight out of the window.The depiction of prison life is pretty ridiculous. Different races all getting on fine, apart from the small group of 'bad guys'. The ending is absolutely awful. If it had ended with red getting released it would have been marginally better. However, to do the typical Hollywood thing of explaining exactly what happens is just rubbish. Note to Hollywood, we can use our brains! I think this film is 2nd in the IMDb Top 250, can someone please explain why? It's a very average film and be warned it will make you sick with its cheesiness!"
824,True,"I don't recall the first time, or subsequent times I have seen this movie, but doing my rankings, my memory of it gave it a 4/10 (3 stars- means I may watch it again, but I don't really want to, 4 stars- I will watch it again, with no plans to, 5 stars- ordinary, will neither discourage or actively encourage people to watch...).I watched it again last night because of it's IMDb ranking to see if the world is right, and I am an a contrary prick... the answer- the world is wrong.Basically this movie has been reviewed too many times by sentimental @$$holes who are too much in love with the richness and satisfaction of Morgan Freemans voice and the lulling of a placid soundtrack.It has some great stars, Clancy Brown is unbelievable, menacing and awesome. Probably one of the only people you can have speak in a Morgan Freeman movie and think- ""What a great voice!"" Robbins, I found to be a whimsical toss, his years of rape didn't make sense, if he was such a good guy, such a smart guy, why he couldn't have solved a 3 year gang rape run? Also, 'Andy' is put in the hole for almost a month and in that time, the guards didn't destroy his poster, a criminal didn't take it down or stick their d@#$ into it? His room never got tossed? The poster never got touched in the dozen years he had it up? He openly talks of his geology skill and his knowledge of cutting rock, and the guards/warden/convicts never saw a 'red flag'?This is just an overly sentimental, Vaseline around the lens 'bow of the Titanic moment' movie, with no wit, grit or heart. I guess I have seen too many realistic and quality prison shows, movies, documentary's to take this dated circle-jerk seriously, it is absolutely no 10/10.A guy spends a decade plus being gang raped, doing tax returns and legal favors for the guards that abuse and in at least one case kill the inmates? This movie is no 'Green Mile' and 'Green Mile' isn't as good as a single episode of 'HBO's- OZ'!I give it an extra star, raising it up to- 5/10, because there is nothing bad about it, and I wouldn't discourage someone from watching it. But don't ask me to score this soft and mushy pointless 'love story', that is too chicken to actually 'show' the love scenes between the two main characters a 10/10 when it's not even as good as the 'Family Guy' parody..."
825,True,"There are a lot of good movies, and then there are movies that have the power to change your life. The Shawshank Redemption is just an extraordinarily inspirational movie. It just isn't a normal prison break story; a very deep implicit definition is buried in every scene of it. The main theme is the presence and the belief in hope by the main character of the story, Andy Dufresne. Repeatedly saying ""hope is a good thing"", Andy finally gets what he always wanted: an escape and a new start in the Pacific, something that was always described as impossible by the other prisoners. I guess that the element that triggered the viewers' attention the most was the optimism and mysterious character of Andy Dufresne. Watching the movie, we weren't really able to read what was going on his mind even though we had implicit clues of the clever and beautiful things he kept to himself. The choice of Tim Robbins as the main persona was well thought by Frank Darabont as he doesn't show a lot of emotions on his face. The bond that connected the inmates, especially Red and Andy was very strong, leading to sacrifices and promises. The friendship between the two men lasts beyond the walls of Shawshank and finds itself reincarnated in Zihuatanejo, the country with no memory. Another thing that strikes the spectators is the enjoyment and the love of the small things in life. This concept was seen in the ""opera music scene"", where the beauty of the music and the voices of the Italian ladies went past the skins and through the souls of the prisoners. The excitement felt by all these men was the only pleasing element that wasn't taken from them in this dangerous place. The most important piece of The Shawshank Redemption was the message that inspired all the movie lovers: every man has value and importance in the world. This message personally helped me slide away from my negative attitude and helped me enjoy every moment of life. For this incredible adaptation of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King, I would like to gratefully thank Frank Darabont sharing his work of art to the world."
826,True,"Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover.

827,True,"SPOILER AHEAD, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARNED. Andy Dufresne is a banker convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. The message that the movie tries to pass is that hope can set you free. It talks about Andy and his friends that lives in jail for a long time, and how Andy became ""successful"" even at jail. Andy knows that his place isn't in there, he dosn't consider himself guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover, he don't even tries to defend himself in the court, so when he's in jail he seems to be so peaceful and tranquilized that the other prisoners thinks he's spoiled, and he suffers from that from time to time because some queers liked him and frequently spanked and raped him. Andy also became friend with the director of the jail and the guard, using his banker skills to help them, but in return he asks for his friends to be treated nicely. Andy has a lot of hobbies, he's affectionate for stones, and he likes to play chess to, but he favorite hobby was dropping rests of what he toked of his wall inside his cell, he toked 20 years to make the entire tunnel and scape, of course he wouldn't leave his friend Red, behind with nothing, he told what the future reserved for them and told him where to look for it. For me the high level of the movie was at the end when they reveal Andy's plan, but it's so complex that I think that you would rather just go and watch the movie. One of my favorite movies of all time."
828,True,"I just saw the movie today. I liked the plot of the movie, and it didn't feel like it lasted for 2,5 hours. During the film, you start to love the prisoners, because you get to know them more and more.I think this isn't the GREATEST movie ever, but it sure as hell is a good movie. I'd rate it a 8 or an 8,5.I like the fact too they show you how the prisoners react when their prison time is over. I find it hard to imagine how i'd feel if i was locked for 50 years. And a happy ending always makes me feel allot better.. although it is a bit dull."
829,True,A film like this comes along every few decades. Its better than savage or amazing the only way to describe it is the greatest film EVER. Its all about a man called Andy Dufresne falsely accused of murder of his wife and her lover and is sent to shawshank prison where he is beaten by the guards and other prisoners. Eventually he makes a friend called Red and fits in with Red. Andy was a smart banker before prison and used his brains to help the other prisoners like solving the guards tax problems then the wardens. Andy finds a way to escape from the prison by digging a hole and using a poster of Rita Hayworth to cover the hole(That is why the short story is called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) Andy escapes but before escaping he told Red to look under a tree when he leaves. Red leaves and finds that Andy under a fake name living in Mexico. The two meet for the first time in years and shake hands. The Shawshank Redemption starts and ends Fascinating.
830,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest examples of Stephen King's work adapted to the big screen. If not THE finest. Based on a short story from King's novella Different Seasons, it may be that rare thing where its a film that actually improves upon its source material. The story, of a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover made for an interesting read, but it made for an even better film.Although TSR was nominated for seven Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one. Most of them went to the completely overrated Forrest Gump, including Best Picture and Best Actor. I think that was one of the Academy's darkest days.Despite the fact TSR did next to no business in 1994, it quickly gathered word of mouth afterwards, and went on to a healthy afterlife on video and TV. But that's not all. It slowly worked its way into the hearts and minds of people the world over, and today it's regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Even a true American classic. And its even No 2 on the IMDb top 250. Beating out Forrest Gump by a significant margin!TSR is also one of the few films in the world that actually deserves all the acclaim it receives. I really loved this movie. I loved everything about it. The theme of maintaining hope in the face of crushing despair could have made for Hallmark TV movie material, but in the hands of first time director Frank Darabont, he's created an utter masterpiece.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the man who allegedly did the crime. He is convicted and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Robbins' performance is interesting if you've seen the one other really good film he made in 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy. There he played a bumbling, doltish fool. His work in TSR is a jarring about face.He completely downplays his emotions to the point of resigned dourness. Its quite a shocking thing to watch. But as good as Robbins' performance is, what makes it that all the more special is Andy's character is opened up not by him, but by an external character.Morgan Freeman, in arguably the best performance of his career plays Red, the prison fixer. He can get things for any inmate. Whether it be cigarettes, or a rock hammer. He is the narrator of the picture, and it is through his words that the world of Shawshank becomes a harsh and frightening reality.He knows the ins and outs of the prison system. When new inmates arrive, he can usually tell which ones won't last. He knows your first night at Shawshank is the worst. New inmates have to endure the catcalls and taunts of their cellmates. Red pegged Andy as the one who would break first. But he never did.Red freely admits he didn't think much of Andy at first. But slowly, the two men become acquaintances, and much later, friends. Morgan Freeman's resigned, soothing voice illuminates the harsh surroundings of the prison walls. The scariest thing about the prison was the Sisters. Sadistic prisoners who turned gay while locked up, and try to convert others. First through suggestion. And if that fails, force. Andy was their favourite target. And he had to endure rapes and beatings for his first two hellish years at Shawshank.Andy's background as an investment banker brings him to the attention of Warden Norton. Norton is a hypocritical tyrant. He claims to be a devout Christian, but he won't tolerate any challenges to his authority. Any who do wind up in solitary. For months at a time if necessary. Norton has Andy secure funds he has embezzled. And in exchange, Andy can procure funds for a new library and even beers for his fellow inmates. As long as he does exactly what Norton tells him to.The Shawshank Redemption resonates on many different levels as it tells many different stories. One of the most poignant is the plight of Brooks, an elderly inmate. Imprisoned for years, when he finally makes parole, he is terrified. Life at Shawshank has become the only life he's ever known. Once released, he knows he'll never survive out there. And he's right. The world has gone and changed on him. And life as a grocery bagger is no life at all. So he hangs himself. Its a haunting story. And one that never fails to choke me up inside.That situation extends to Red too. In Shawshank, he has a purpose. He is respected, valued, needed. Parole is not much different than a death sentence. He gets rejected for parole frequently over the course of 30 years. And he couldn't be happier.The most wrenching thing of all is Andy's apparent deterioration. He believes in hope. And tries to inspire some in his cellmates when he plays Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over the PA system. That scene is a joyful moment to behold, with the men in the yard transfixed by the music. And Norton punishes him for his defiance. Andy seems to reach breaking-point when he confesses to Red he might as well have murdered his wife, because he didn't show her enough love and affection.It seems Norton has finally broken Andy. But when Andy escapes, its a triumphal moment. That famous scene, after Andy crawls 500 yds through a sewage pipe, standing in a downpour, relishing his first taste of freedom. It will send your spirits sky-high.Things end appropriately with Andy and later Red gaining freedom, on a secluded island. I love the way the camera observes their reunion from a distance. After their souls have been laid to bear, they deserve some privacy. One of the defining pictures of our generation. An experience I love to re-visit over and over.Magnificent!"
831,True,The Shawshank Redemption is a gripping masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. Andy Dufrense keeps us in suspense the entire way with his mysterious attitude to prison life and his claim that he is innocent. Tim Robbins performs excellently. Morgan Freemans role as Red telling the story was also quite an interesting touch. When I hired this film my expectations were not that it would become one of my favorite movies of all time. Guys definitely this is something you have to see for yourself and you will be categorically satisfied. Many unexpected twists and turns and actually quite plausible considering the time it's set in. I found myself on the edge of my seat almost the entire way. There are many touching and feel good scenes also particularly when Andy and his friends share a few beers in the sun on the roof after dealing his superior and for a few moments feel like free men. Fantastic film check it out if you haven't seen it re-watch if you have. 5 stars.
832,True,"Frank Darabont's beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an experience to remember for life. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and is sent to prison in New England for murdering his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman is Red, the man in prison who can get things for you. Together, they forge a lasting friendship as Andy's hope helps penetrate the thick walls in Shawshank prison, in more ways than one.Andy's first few years at Shawshank are filled with beatings and molestation's by a group of cretins called the ""Sisters."" The leader is a man named Bogs who gives slime balls a good name. Sometimes Andy fights them off but as Red points out, ""Prison is no fairy tale world."" Red arranges for his friends and Andy to tar the roof of the plate factory giving them all a nice rest from the prison walls. Red is definitely a man with connections. Clancy Brown is the picture of cruelty as the head of the guards named Byron Hadley. Andy overhears Hadley complaining about how the government is gonna take a nice chunk from his brother's inheritance. Andy informs Hadley how he could keep most of his brother's inheritance by allowing a tax free gift to his wife. Hadley nearly throws him off the roof but manages to hear him out. Andy sets up the papers for him in exchange for getting Red and his friends three beers a piece. To everyone's surprise Hadley agrees. This wins Andy a lot of friends especially when one offers him a beer and he tells him he's quit drinking.The warden gets wind of Andy's accounting skills and realizes he can use him to do his taxes. Andy gets a vicious beating from Bogs and the ""Sisters"" but this time Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp, crippling him and having him drinking through a straw for the rest of his life. Bogs is transferred out and the ""Sisters"" never touch Andy again.When Andy returns he finds the poster of Rita Hayworth he asked Red for. It comes with a note that says ""Free of Charge."" Red and his friends are happy Andy is back and well. The Warden, played chillingly by Bob Gunton as greed personified, transfers Andy into the library and out of the laundry where Andy worked and endured beatings the first couple of years.Andy soon becomes an assistant to Brooks, an old prisoner nicely played by James Whitmore. Brooks cares for a bird named Jake and is well liked by Red and his friends. Later, Brooks is released and finds he's institutionalized and can't make it in the real world. Sadly, he kills himself and this worries Red more than anyone because he's constantly rejected by the Parole Board and fears being institutionalized.Andy sends out many letters requiring more funding for the library, with the permission of the warden, and gets it converted into a beautiful place in memory of Brooks. There, Andy helps many prisoners get their Higschool education's.Andy helps one man in particular out, a young thief named Tommy, that Red and his friends like as well. Later, Red and Andy find out that man spent time in prison with the real man who killed Andy's wife and her lover. Andy tells the warden and the warden has Hadley shoot Tommy to death.Andy is now trapped helping the corrupt Warden with all his dirty money. He confides in Red and tells him he wants to spend the rest of his life on an island in the pacific. Red tells him not to think like that but Andy gives Red instructions to find something of his when he gets out. Red promises too but is worried about Andy. Andy says his choice is ,""Get busy living or get busy dying."" The rest you can find out for yourself in this thought provoking and perfectly acted film. This is not just some prison movie but a movie about the harsh realities of confinement, the choices we make in our life, and of having hope despite the worst circumstances.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have never been better as well as the supporting cast. William Sadler does a nice job as Heywood, the Hank Williams loving friend who thinks a book in the library is called THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISCO.Frank Darabont directs this film so well you truly hate for it to end. Roger Deakins Cinematography is epic and inspiring and Thomas Newman's score finds just the right mood. This film is one of those you turn on in the middle of and just watch to the end, an incredibly deep and moving experience."
833,True,"I liked this film a lot!! This is the best film i ever seen! A like films about jail or something, especially when such films are long... - - - Morgan Freeman is very good actor... A lot of his films are good Of course there other good actors Also there are some funny places to watch..., but this film was brutal. People who haven't seen this film, i recommend them to watch it... The film beginning was the best in the film i think, but I liked the end too. Some horrible things happened there too, like when that ""Elvis"" man killed... and of course when old man (Brooks) died. I would like to watch this film again for many times."
834,True,"***Contains Spoilers*** This movie is a touching quite film about one man's quest for dignity in a dehumanizing prison system and his finding freedom. This movie has two baffo performances by Morgan Freeman as Red ""the man who can get things"" Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense the quiet banker who escapes the soul crushing hell on earth that is Shawshank prison my first thoughts when i saw this was ""this is based on a Stephen King book?? huh this is really deep and emotional"" so needless to say it comes of as something you wouldn't expect IL King to write but the movie is a great touching look at the indomitable human spirit and friendship it is a very good movie."
835,True,"This shouldn't be #3. In fact, it should be #1. I believe the writing behind a film is the most important aspect of it. This movie tells a story of a man who was left to die for something he never did, and how he takes what is given to him, and creates a intellectual paradise for himself and fellow inmates. Being such a genius, he is able to cover all his bases knowing that all of it could come crashing down, and it did. He makes a thought impossible escape, exposes his biggest enemy for what he is, and takes all his money which rightfully belongs to him anyway. It is a genius script and both actors are in my top 10. I love this movie, and it's second to none as it takes the most important aspects of film-making and owns all other movies at them. (Although props to Charlie Kaufman for being the coolest writer ever, but still not making my #1 movie)"
836,True,"The best I've seen so far in my life. I have missed it when it came out and actually I only saw it last week. It was a rerun on TV way after midnight. I went to bed a 4 o'clock in the morning and next day bought the DVD. It absolutely great and 9.0 it's way too small a mark for this one :) The main idea is about an extremely smart guy who knows how to keep its mouth shut :) ... but I guess there were others that commented the plot earlier so I can't bring new stuff to it :) If you missed this movie then go and rent it, buy it do whatever's necessary to see it because it's 100% worth. The plot is great, the characters are exquisitely built and you won't be able to guess what happens. Tim Robins makes the role of his life in my opinion, and Morgan Freeman is also great.Just to compare I have recently saw ""Escape From Alcatraz"", which by the way was aired in prime time &#61516;, and it's not even close to this one.Final advice: YOU MUST SEE IT."
837,True,"'The Shawshank Redemption' may be hard to convince somebody to watch, but it's important to make sure everyone does. A prison movie is not the way it should be classified because 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a story about people. It is told through a prison and the idea that would be a cliché in any other film, hope. So, hope no longer becomes a cliché because it is realistic in Shawshank. Thus, people and their motives and environments make films interesting, realistic, influential, and memorable. And because Frank Darabont found a way to get all of these elements into the greatest film ever made, people who see 'The Shawshank Redemption' look at life at a whole new perspective. That being to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"", and to always have hope."
838,True,"Spoiler!! The philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the finest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and despair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the philosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to consider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so poignantly delivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his nightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation into the culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging to an inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in assimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole rejections have become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting out of prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly views Shawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses concern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when Red proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood. Red, in essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope and rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to sell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether Andy has reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really matter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it is the manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in Red's parole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the same despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier. Only when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton is Red presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and rejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly from Red's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on his impulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside the greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's philosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.
In doing so, he provides a happy ending to a film that may live on forever due to the criticality of its subject matter and its masteful delivery of its message."
839,True,"I don't like this movie because it is boring and stupid,not entertaining and nothing interesting...i don't know why it is even in top 250...people,please vote 1 for this,look at movie to see how bad it is,and you will vote 1,because you will see how stupid,boring and not interesting this film is....please,vote 1 and save film art,don't let this garbage rule wonderful art of movies...how many film there are,that are truly art made of geniuses are under this garbage of film...you cannot put this garbage on first place...first place of all movies is holly place for films,it should be some masterpiece put in there...please,people,vote 1 for this garbage,i don't want to look this even in top 250...dont destroy world of film,people,boring and stupid film is not for top 250,especially not for number 1...i feel sorry for epic,legendary masterpieces that are under...this...i hate this film with all my hart and soul 1 out of 10 cheers"
840,True,"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to very good actors star in this movie about Tim wrongfully accused and sent to prison where he befriends Morgan Freeman. I mean it was a good movie and a i liked it, it just didn't blow me away and I guess thats how I rate a movie from Good or Great, I like it don't get me wrong, its just i didn't get the same feeling i get from other great movies, it didn't have me thinking about the character, whats happening next, it wasn't riveting, it was kinda slow I guess just dragging from scene to scene. To be perfectly honest I would personally rank this movie at like an 8.1 - 8.2, I guess I just kinda figured that he would get out, and a movie like that where you can pretty much guess whats going to happen there is much to stay and watch, I didn't feel they would leave the movie with him in prison and thats pretty much what did it for me.I mean this is purely my opinion, I know some people who love this movie and they bring up their valid points, but right now I am sharing my point of view with everyone about this movie."
841,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who finds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a murderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a curious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not make the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in 2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all time, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films. Readers of Time Out and Empire magazines also named it among their very favourites."
842,True,"OK OK OK Shawshank's a very good film. Not in MY top 25, or even top 50, but it's a good film. Robbins and Freeman certainly work magic and the story is quite entertaining, if a tad predictable, especially the Hollywood happy ending. However, this film is FAR from being the ""#2"" best movie in the IMDb top 250. In fact, Shawshank Redemption as the # 2 film is the most overrated anything I've ever come across. Maybe somebody will rank Paulie Shore as the # 2 greatest actor, but until that time this one wins most overrated, hands down. I really don't think this film deserves a 3 rating, heck I might give it a 5, but if there's folks blowing this thing way out of proportion with 10's then somebody's got to slip an underrating in there just to weed out the Shawshank homers...."
843,True,"I just saw this movie yesterday and now I feel ridiculous for waiting so long.  It was really great and I am sorry it did not win any Oscars, because it deserved to win more than ""Forrest Gump"", in my opinion.  Tim Robbins actually played a likable guy and Morgan Freeman was perfection.
SPOILER ALERT!!!I cried when ""Red"" was given parole! I also should have known what was going to happen to Tommy Williams, but that caught me by surprise.
I do have one problem with the movie, but I got over it right away and did not diminish from the entire experience.  If Andy's cell was on an upper level, and in between other cells, where was this tunnel he built actually supposed to be? The ending was very cathartic, thank God.  After the brutality and injustice portrayed in the movie, we needed that. And the ending was very beautiful too."
844,True,"Wow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40 times... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why: First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unrestrictive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them as Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world.just the joke :D"
845,True,"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A good tagline for a great prison drama from writer/director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile), based on the book by Stephen King. Basically Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is the lawyer convicted for the murder of his wife, sent to Shawshank prison, headed by the nasty Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). While he is there he is quiet for a while, but eventually he forms a friendship with black Irish marketeer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman, and the character was originally a white red haired Irishman), retains hope and gains respect of fellow inmates. After a while, he gets to do a lot of personal work for the Warden sorting documents, founding a new library and improving a lot of other things, with his law and mathematical skills. One day though, he seems strange towards Red when he asks him to find a specific tree somewhere he knows, and the next morning, he has escaped (scraping through the soft wall with a chisel). Andy and Red do eventually find each other again in the happy emotional ending, well, many moments in the film are emotional. It was a flop in the cinemas, and since release to video and DVD it has become a favourite with many film goers. Also starring William Sadler as Heywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron T. Hadley, Gil Bellows as Tommy and James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Morgan Freeman was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the scene where classical operatic music plays in the prison, it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 13 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!"
846,True,"It seems that every time a movie comes out with an exceedingly positive and uplifting message or story, the average moviegoer is blind to any other problems or shortcomings the film might have. Every moment of this film feels phony and hollow. The character of Red (Morgan Freeman) is just a vehicle to keep the plot moving and doesn't seem to even exist as a whole person. His narration is embarrassing with its phony regional dialect and forced folksiness. The prison life depicted, while brutal and violent in a few scenes, is overromanticized by the picturesque cinematography and florid music. The plot is fairly clever but, like bad American television, everything that happens is in service of the plot. There's no behavior from the characters that doesn't help bring you to the film's stunningly maudlin final scene. And there are logistical problems, like the fact that you can't make a hole in a thick metal sewer pipe by hitting it with a rock three times. They could have solved this problem by just showing a shot of a clock moving forward. The best character is a relatively brief and peripheral one, Brooks (James Whitmore). Whitmore doesn't seem to know he's in such a shallow, contrived movie and gives the character a realism and three-dimensionality the other characters don't have in his short time on screen. In the montage-type scene in which he's trying to cope with life out of prison, however, he suddenly seems less intelligent and more of a stereotype of a befuddled old man. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is somewhere between good and mediocre, seeming to force weird expressions onto his face like he just read the character description in the script for the first time. Bob Gunton as Warden Norton is over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional, but it works because Bible-thumpers are often over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional. He's actually believable and interesting to watch. The prison guard Hadley (Clancy Brown) is realistically sadistic, but his type of comically crude sexual language sounds too contemporary for the time. The final scene is just so unrealistically over-the-top happy and sunny it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence and, I think, ruins much of the film. This film obviously has developed a huge following over the years, but I think that's largely just because of it's sentiment of hopefulness and positivity, and that doesn't necessarily indicate a well-written, well-executed, well-acted film. Some of the worst crap in theatres and on television has a hopeful, inspiring, uplifting message. Of course a film doesn't have to depict a realistic world. In fact, I like surrealism in movies. But it should at least show an interesting version of a world, and to keep any intelligent viewer's attention the characters have to be fully realized, seemingly existing in a world outside of the film's plot."

This situation reminds me of Brave New World. One of the future citizens in there goes to a theater to see a movie with ""the savage"". The future and civilized man (or woman, I don't remember) is fascinated with it. But the Savage tries to make him notice that the plot was a truly rubbish, truly predictable and truly untruly.

848,True,"Just having registered with IMDb, I thought a good movie to start my reviewing with would be the one which users have rated the best of the best. This is one of my favorite films & over the years I have watched it or portions of it whenever it happening to be playing on TV, probably mustering up a good 20-30 viewings to the point that I thought I could nearly recite the films dialogue word for word. That anyone could rate any film 10 out of 10 I figure is more a function of the mind of the viewer, and its penchant for exaggeration after watching a film which happens to induce some powerful emotions in him, rather than any inherent perfection in the piece. Whatever the truth may be I offer here some reasons why this particular film, although moving and well made in it's own right, cannot be the best film made by the hands of man.#6: It seemed to me that the evidence for convicting Andy at the beginning was badly inadequate. There was no murder weapon found & no prints of his found inside the building the murders took place. His story was consistent, and though he had motive for getting wasted and driving around, its a big step to murder, and what guilty man freely admits he had a gun and planned on using it to scare the adulterers, when on trial for his life? An upright, honest man with faith and trust in the judicial system, thats who. Small wonder he was so shocked to here the judge give his sentence. And who was Andy's lawyer, Lionel Hutz?, did they not dust the murder scene for prints to give an idea of a possible involvement from another party etc?#5: The night he decides to escape just happens to be a stormy one with loud peals of thunder perfectly disguising his rocking the sewage line? c'mon!#4: The guy has been in the same cell for 19 years. All the time an enormous poster has been draped over the subway tunnel like hole to freedom he has been digging away at each night. No guard in that span felt he might have a curious peek-a-boo under the poster during the cell checks?#3: I was a little incredulous at the good faith the warden seemed to show Andy after he had completed his 2nd warden ordered ordeal in the hole. ""Its good to have you back Andy, place has'nt been the same without you"" Did the warden remember putting Andy in the hole in the 1st place, for pleading and proving his innocence to him, remember having the man shot who could have restored Andy's life, I thought a man smart enough to contrive all of the fraudulent operations that were making the warden rich would at least merit a small deal of suspicion from the warden. ""what else might this man be capable of?""#2: Andy's job on the outside was as a banker not a priest, the movie continues to show how clever he is and flexible at making the most of his limited resources in the joint, but when and how did he find time to memorize that enormous book that is the bible? passage for passage, line for line? his mastery of this difficult book is shown in giving the exact chapter and line reference after the warden quotes him a segment of the book. Perhaps that is why his wife wanted to leave him, after work he was up all night till 4am memorizing segments of the bible, but more likely not.#1: Finally and I thought most implausibly, the new guy Andy taught to read and write just happened to have the information on the ""real killer"" For this to happen I thought the following chance happenings would have to conspire: 1: he happens to share a cell with the killer at some other prison 2: the killer chooses to tell him that he killed a couple & a banker got the blame for it 3: he finds himself in another prison where Andy resides 4: of the many convicts, he happens to form a friendship with red and Andy and their small crew 5: red happens to spill the beans about Andy's crime to him I thought all this was a little unlikelyIn summary, great movie, great dialogue, excellent performances, and great vindication of the power of hope, the rewards of perseverance and the importance of sticking to ones core values regardless of external circumstances, not the best of the best, but what is? 7 out of 10"
849,True,"Let me start by stating that this is one of the most sad, poignant and beautiful films I've seen since Paranormal Entity. I feet that Tom Hanks' portrayal of a bored police officer was cutting edge at the time and has yet to be surpassed by any actor in any film since, excluding Shane Van Dyke's potentially career defining performance in Shane Van Dyke's Paranormal Entity (written by Shane Van Dyke). Michael Clarke Duncan's interpretation of the character John Cofey was banal to say the least, but I was more than compensated for this error in judgement with two deliciously witty comedy set pieces. One was where a rat got knocked out and one was where he forgot to put a sponge on his head. As an aside, I enjoyed the skit in which Michael Clarke Duncan refused to give Moon's Sam Rockwell a slice of bread and the bit where Tom Hanks couldn't take a wazz.In conclusion, I award this film 2 golden skulls. Half a star for the scene where the rat dies, and one star for Tim Robins crawling through a crapper. I am also awarding the film two golden skulls for the scene in which Tom Hanks bangs his wife after John Cofey heals him.Overall - 3 golden skulls (Paranormal Entity earned 9 golden skulls) cheers"
850,True,"this is the best movie i seen till yet One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands."

852,True,"This film wasn't that successful when it was released. Over the years since then, it's become regarded by many people as one of the best films ever made. It's an above-average prison film that's well-acted - but it's nothing special. It's slow and too long. Many fans of this film claim that it's a feel-good film - an uplifting story about friendship and mental strength. Some even claim that watching it can cure depressed viewers. However, it's a heavy-going film that includes beatings and rape.We never find out whether or not the protagonist committed the double murder that he's imprisoned for, which is a crucial point as a viewer. If he's innocent, then we should be on his side and want him to escape; if he's guilty, then he's not a sympathetic character."
853,True,"Would recommend to anyone who is having a bad day. Morgan Freeman is an absolute stand out. The subtly in his acting is what makes this film, that in addition with direction and writing makes for a both inspirational and heart warming film. The Bogs and crow subplot leaves a second political note and ultimately a strong feeling for change with the audience."
854,True,"The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time.Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not ""some actors."" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here.Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development.I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings.Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed.It is hard to fathom that a ""prison"" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison.Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe ""The Shawshank Redemption."" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. ""Shawshank Redemption"" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within."

856,True,"Where I'm I going to start , well this magnificent work of art directed by the big Frank Darabont and co-writing bu the legendary Stephen king and started by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was just as perfect as it allows it to lead the 250 top IMDb table, yeah ,it had everything from directing ,writing and acting until good soundtracks and cinematography ,not to mention the unforeseen twisted ending which had me blocked for what it remained from the film . the shawshank redemption was overtaken in the 95th for the benefit of Forrest Gump who was truly a masterpiece and Pulp fiction who was also out of this world but still the shawshank deserved more at least for me ,I mean it is one of few who could led me into this state of admiration and worship even and for that it's and it will always be my all time favorite film ."
857,True,"Phillip Fawcett piano teacher says this is the greatest redemption movie of them all. And I should know, since the music world was a life I'm only too delighted to be out of. Strictly speaking, Shawshank is not 'redemption', because after all what did the guy need redeeming 'from'? He was innocent. It is basically a giant metaphor for a journey from an entrapped and miserable existence to a beautiful promised land. It is set as a prison story, but really symbolizes any arena of life where one may feel hopeless and desperate to get out of a seemingly impossible situation.Beautifully written with a host of engaging characters, where for once the good are equally as interesting as the bad. I always find it curious that in many prison dramas when the guards, especially the warden, are the bad guys whereas the inmates (criminals, we assume) are the good. At least the protagonists are. Take Escape from Alcatraz as another example. I wonder what this says about our society and the concept of good and evil we have deep down? I believe it's a closet hatred of authority in general. A fear of the state, perhaps. With good reason."
858,True,"This movie has all of the best Hollywood has to offer from A-list actors to stunning scenery to a dialogue that will not leave you wanting. It delves into the mind and soul in ways you probably can't imagine. the plot seems believable as do the characters portrayed. If you have a soul, you will laugh, cry, get angry, be pleased and relieved. Andy is a character you will love and the prison workers you will hate. You really do get the whole gamut of emotions in this one. I have seen this one as many times as any other movie I've ever seen and I never get tired of it. My wife and I can sit down with this one several times a year and love it the same every time. You will love it!!"
859,True,"This ranks among my favorite movies of all time. I'd say it's tied for first place. The ending is perhaps the most satisfying ending to a movie that I've ever seen. It's not necessarily the type of movie you watch over and over, yet I have watched it several times and it's engaging entertainment each time I watch. In fact, I would say that this movie goes beyond the pure entertainment category. It's a story that is truly inspiring. Morgan Freeman's character, Red, delivers a voice-over towards the end about hope that is perhaps the best voice-over in cinema history. I know I'm laying it on thick, but I truly love this movie. There are certainly scenes that are hard to watch, as Tim Robbins character goes through many trials while incarcerated, but the way he makes it through them is quite amazing. I was surprised to learn that this is based on a piece of fiction by Stephen King, but the more I learn about him, the more I see that he writes a lot more than just horror novels. I hope to read the book one day, as I'd bet it is quite good. Every aspect of this movie is pure perfection: directing, acting, editing, soundtrack... the list goes on. It has a permanent place in my movie collection and it also should in yours."

862,True,"I'm not sure that I would crawl through a pile of crap for my freedom, just saying. How did the poster get back into place? What happens to them after they have found their freedom? Do they enjoy it? Do they go back to their old ways of doing things? What kind of life do they lead?--that being said, how much time is left for them on this earth? If they believe in redemption, do they believe in an afterlife? What do they do with their money? What do they spend it on? Do they buy new clothes? Did they not have what they needed in jail? Were they not given three meals a day, a cot, a toilet. Perhaps their life was too simple and they wanted to make it more complicated. Perhaps they had grown bored with their lives and were looking for excitement. That being said, I must feel really freaking desperate, really output to crawl through a sewer, and perhaps they feel this way after being locked up for a long time. So yes, this man is brace. It seems they have change. I enjoyed watching this movie; I believe the actors played their parts well. Well-done"
863,True,"The plot, the acting, the big name stars all in their greatest roles. Even the music was spectacular. I give it a 10 without hesitation and watch it every time it shows up on cable. Morgan Freeman shines alongside Timothy Hutton a pairing that works for both. Freeman should have won an Academy Award for his performance. Everyone in the cast brings the dark side out of prison life along with the sometimes comedic side of doing hard time. The time line advances according to the pin-ups requested by Dufresne (Hutton) , giving the viewers an idea of the era. Freeman as ""Red"" is the jail-wise con that repeatedly is turned away by the system. A must watch."
864,True,"Best movie. From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted."
865,True,"This is the best movie i've watched so far till now. The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
866,True,"The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a banker accused of the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, he meets an inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding, who Dufresne befriends. Redding is the narrator of the movie talking about his past experience at Shawshank. Over the 19 year period that the movie takes place, Red and Dufresne grow closer, and the tale follows tragic losses of friends, corruption of the prison's staff, and a great escape. This movie is a great movie for those who like a 'justice served' type movie as well as a well written one. In general, foreshadowing indicates that the story is well written enough to the point where the writers can make a reference to the future about what is going to happen. In one scene, Dufresne is carving names into the walls in his cell block. The scene then shifts to Dufresne asking Red if he can acquire a poster (because Red is the guy who can 'get things' in prison). Throughout the entire movie, every scene in Dufresnes cell shows that poster. At the end of the movie it is revealed that the poster hanging on the wall was used to cover a hole that Dufresne had been digging since the night he was carving the names in the wall. He accidentally discovered how flimsy the walls were, and realized he could tunnel out. This makes the movie good because the scenes leading up to the end hinted at the fact that there was something special about the poster, however the audience was never sure. When it was revealed at the end, the audience can make the connection between that night he asked for the poster and the scene where the hole is discovered. Andy Dufresne is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, however it is never actually revealed if he did it or not. The movie goes along hinting that Dufresne is innocent and although it is never confirmed, I found myself trusting the fact that he did not do it. Throughout the movie, Dufresne is treated very poorly, such as being used to launder money for the prison due to his banking background. So when news comes in of a new inmate who confessed to Dufresne crime, Dufresne tries to convince the Warden that he is innocent and demands a retrial or probation. The Warden denies him but at a cost; Dufresne escapes and reveals the corruption at Shawshank causing the Warden to commit suicide to avoid arrest. In general, people who pity Dufresne in his position would feel that he won in the end, escaping the prison and revealing the warden's corruption. This is enjoyable because it has a sense of karma, where because the warden treated Dufresne so poorly, he got fooled in the end. Therefore, this movie is a good movie for people who enjoy social justice type movies, because Dufresne beat the Warden and escaped the prison, as well as for people who enjoy deep movies, that are well written, as demonstrated through the foreshadowing that the writers put into it."
867,True,"What an enjoyable movie The Shawshank Redemption turned out to be and a true classic. At first glance, the title immediately through me off. It honestly didn't seem like the type of movie I would like. As I got further into the movie however, the storyline began to catch my interest. Andy Dufresne is a well to do banker. He seems intelligent, somewhat corny and well to do. You can imagine my confusion as to how he winds up in prison. Through an interesting plot twist early on in the movie, it seems Andy is falsely accused of a horrendous crime and sentenced to time in prison. Right from the beginning he hits it off with Red, a black older gentleman who seems to be the go to man for everything. Throughout the film Red and Andy develop a loyal friendship that gets them both through the many years of imprisonment. While doing time Andy finds out that there is a way to prove his innocence and is hopeful that he will be released. After expressing that hope to Norton, the warden Andy realizes that he has no intention of helping him and that he would face many more years behind bars. This realization causes Andy to do the unthinkable and Right from the start I felt like the theme was going to be along the lines of hope, never giving up, make the most of your situation or never judge a book by its cover. Andy kept his cool and was hopeful that he would be 'redeemed' throughout most of the movie. You get the sense that he knew he would be proved innocent. He remained hopeful and helpful at all times similar to Pi in Life of Pi. From the beer that he finagled for the prisoners on that hot Summer day, books in the library that he requested and received and the assistance that he provided during tax time, he was definitely more than meets the eye. You honestly don't really expect the ending at all. I didn't really think he'd have that in him. This is a King film though so you know there will be unexpected plot twists.The setting completely made the movie. A drab prison in a remote location, a smelly sewage line and absolutely no grab just sets a tone for unpleasantry, seclusion and discontentment. Considering where Andy came from it was a complete contrast and definitely took some getting used to. Even the transformation of the library - an attempt from Andy in seeking normalcy, was completely realistic in that they took a barren prison room and created shelving, a similar dewey decimal system and structure. The costumes also played an important role within the film and worked hand in hand with the setting. All prisoners wear the same type of clothing and style. There are no stand outs. Some items were more worn than others and some just plain didn't fit well depending on the person. He helped to portray an idea of what it would really be like in prison.Ultimately the movie took a case of misfortune and showed based off circumstances, the lengths that someone would go when the odds are against them. The director also showed us that in the most unlikely places how a true friendship can blossom. Never giving up hope, never judging a book by it's cover."
868,True,"So, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Where do I start? The 1994 prison drama based on the Steven King novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', from his 1982 collection 'Different Seasons'. Andy Dufresne, a banker from Maine, is convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve a life sentence. There, he meets Red, a prisoner who smuggles items from the outside world. Andy, who had been an amateur geologist before being jailed, asks Red to get him a rock hammer for shaping rocks he collects from the exercise yard into small sculptures. One of the next items he orders from Red is a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the ensuing years, Andy regularly requests more posters from Red, including pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. When asked, Andy tells Red that he likes to imagine he can step through the pictures and be with the actresses. So now you've got a basic overview; let's get into the protagonist and of this fictional prison tale - Andy Dufresnse. As previously stated, Andy is a banker from Maine. At first sight Andy comes across an icy and cold man, whilst in the court room; causing the viewer to lean towards deeming him guilty, rather than innocent. The saying 'Never judge a book by its cover' springs to mind in this instance. We find out Andy is a well educated and extremely crafty gentleman because of his ability to sculpt small rocks with a rock hammer, and his knack for self-education through reading books.A pivotal character in this films plot is Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding; of whom interestingly - is of Irish heritage; hence the last name 'Redding'. As you may have picked up his nickname is'Red and it is a play on words ofhis last name. He was sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine in 1927, because he planned and carried out his wife's murder by disabling her brakes which accidentally killed a neighbour and child as well, which earned him a life sentence at Shawshank Prison. In the film he is known as the 'guy who can get things' as he regularly smuggles many items into the prison with help from others. Also, a very craft and intelligent man.It is also an incredibly moving story, which makes you ponder what it'd be like to feel as trapped as the prisoners, and to feel the desperation they would have. Not to ruin the plot completely but 'Red' described himself as 'institutionalised', which made him feel like he'd struggle to exist outside the walls of Shawshank. To me, It's a powerful, poignant and thought-provoking film like no other; which truly has the ability to alter your outlook on life, and I believe it could change it in a positive way as it teaches you to be grateful for the life you have, as some others are much worse off than you are. I also admire the attention given to the story, which no other movie that I have watched has quite done. And that is why I consider it as one of my all-time favourites."
869,True,"Actually Shawshank is one of the best movies I have seen in the American theater it is a complete movie what is meant by the word beautiful photography, exquisite story, crew influential representation. Is a film directed and written creator Frank Darapont It is the movie that I recommend every one to see it, this movie can change your life and stick in your memory forever. It is the one who deserves our praise and analysis, viewing and also return, in fact it is more than just a movie. Tells us a written novel by Stephen King and talk about Andy Dufferin and who was working as a banker brilliant, then discovers one day his wife betrayed him with another man, he is accused of killing her and thrown in jail for life. Then spin most of the events of the film there, the prison forthcoming .. Shawshank Prison."
870,True,"Shawshank is arguably the most overrated film I have ever seen, perhaps joint with Forrest Gump (although Shawshank is superior to that.) This is a good movie, with good characters and a nice storyline. That's pretty much it. There's nothing close to excellence in this film, the characters, whilst relatable, are very one dimensional. The bad guys are bad and the good guys are good. There is no development to them, they are simply archetypes, and for film with the word 'redemption' in its title, there is no redemption to be shown. Morgan Freeman's character is redeemed from the start, and Tim Robbin's character has nothing to redeem for anyway - they are simply two characters lacking in depth who fail to grow throughout the film.There are points of the film that do have an emotional punch, and it is certainly a film worth watching, but it's far too shallow to be considered great. I have always felt as though I am watching an afternoon TV movie when I see this - it is a simple film, with simple characters that lacks in deep themes, ambiguity and development, instead opting to tell you everything through the (largely) unnecessary narration. Is Shawshank a good film? Yes, it is. Is it great? Absolutely not."
871,True,"think every generation has their films that they can relate to. My generation related to films like Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and Fasstimes at Ridgemont High. Not to say that these films cannot make an impression on today's youth, because I'm sure that they can, but they were definitely films that appealed to kids my age in the 80's. Napolean Dynamite is a film that, in my opinion, is much more of a film that appeals to today's youth. Napolean is a slacker and just wants to be left alone. He has his circle of friends but for the most part, as the poster says, he is out to prove that he has nothing to prove. The film is humorous in some parts, pedestrian in others and overall it is a film that for someone like me ( 33 years old ), it probably doesn't work as well as it does for someone who is in high school. I know many kids that enjoyed this film and most of it was because of Jon Heder. He embodies the very spirit of Napolean Dynamite and even though I found the film to quite average, I have to admit that even I enjoyed Heder's performance. He obviously has a bright future ahead of him with a total of 7 films to his credit in the next two years."

The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
873,True,"Christopher Nolan brings yet another adrenaline-filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well. When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and a violent masked villain (Tom Hardy). This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Nolan used actors that had either appeared in previous Batman films or in his blockbuster hit Inception, and all of them shone in their respective roles: Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in his Bane costume, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard were both excellentand obviously comfortable with Nolan's directing style and the film's dramatic tone."
874,True,"When I heard that this movie bombed at the box office during its theatrical run, I was very surprised as this is simply an all time classic. Rarely is narration in a movie been done as well as this, Morgan Freeman simply becomes Ellis Redding whose depiction of a hardened con who has accepted that he may never get out and goes through his parole hearings not caring about the outcome. Tim Robbins becomes Andy Dufresne and his portrayal of a man who is really out of his depth and his element, and finding adjusting to life on the inside difficult, almost impossible. The changing relationship between the two characters from initial hostility to deep almost brother like friendship is captivating. Clancy Brown's depiction of the tyrannical Captain Baron Hadley is amazing and likewise Bob Gunton as the hypocritical bible bashing, Warden Norton. The other characters like wise are also well done, especially Brooks and sadistic inmate Boggs. The depiction is what you'd expect from a prison movie and while depicting a life of boring monotony and routine show occasionally punctuated by brief moments of excitement is still fascinating thanks to the soundtrack and of course Morgan Freeman's narration, and I don't want to spoil the ending but it climaxes perfectly with not a dry eye in sight, thanks to the pacing, and the dialogue can't be faulted. Now in regard to the differences from the book, these are for the most part minor and if anything enhance the story rather than hinder it, a rarity. In summary this is a must watch for all movie lovers."
875,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is a fine and heartwarming tale that holds up after over 20 years. The film is about a man named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to prison after it is ruled he killed his wife. In my mind, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best ""feel good"" movies because it is not afraid to present darker themes (suicide, rape, corruption, etc.) and explore the brutality of prison life. But by presenting such a low for the main characters, the audience feels more when the heroes succeed in the end. I feel that Andy is a character most people can empathize, which is critical for a movie of this type. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a solid film that leaves a good feeling with the viewer, even after the credits roll."
876,True,"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
877,True,"The shaw shank redemption is undoubtedly a good film, no movement, no special effects, even no beauty, but still can impress the audience, and after more than ten years and charm. It depend on what attracted us? Some say because it reflects the toughness of the ""human nature"". Indeed, with a small hammer, nearly 20 years, the personal control is very strict fascist prison, unearthed a small escape tunnel (perhaps call hew to knock a small tunnel is more suitable, the hammer is too small). Isn't this resilience reflects the people? But I think the plot is dramatic obviously, this is just a director in the arrangement of the plot, at the end of this just in order to reflect the ""self-salvation"" Andy finally succeeded, otherwise the whole plot and theme. So some people think that, ""the shaw shank redemption"" reflect is actually ""hope"" is how valuable to the people. Yes, the film directly when it comes to have lots of hope. Such as Andy escaped prison after letter to Rhetta said: ""Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing (dies."" Maybe that's what works and director want to tell us. ""Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free."" This sentence has become a famous. To me, ""the shaw shank redemption"" touched my place not only on this. Tell me about my ideas about the characters in the film first. A shark fort prison, the prisoners inside and officials, seems to be that our society. High above the warden NORTON, at ordinary times, on the lines, such as the bible actually gain by hook or by crook, cruel and cunning and greed. Guards long Haley and other officers, and vicious brutality, ACTS as NORTON's thugs, grass Jan the prisoner's life. They are like a power class in our reality? I call it a shark fort ruler of the ""small society"". There are different in the prisoners. Besides the protagonist Andy, Rhetta (Morgan Freeman) is a key figure, of course, I think he is a clue of the film: in fact, the whole movie dialogue is not much, in the film a lot of want to show the things is by Rhetta monologue, which were mostly Rhetta to shaw shank life reflection to summarize and his interpretation of Andy. Rhett is a wise man, and he in shark fort mix very well, make the demand of people he was less than ""no"". His wisdom and insight into the shark fort the essence of life, he said to Andy: ""the shark fort, hope is a dangerous thing"", this is the wise man's tongue. In my environment, people will say ""Rhetta comrade very sophisticated,"" at such a time. However, and the reality of the so-called ""wise men"", although Rhetta see see through the essence of the shark fort, but he didn't want to fight in the past, not to mention influence and change others, he is only conform to the rules in order to protect themselves in the shaw shank. Until Andy appear, changed his, and eventually lead him to the freedom of the other shore."

879,True,"One of the most beautiful and well directed and produced movies I have ever seen in 1990s Movie Series,Morgan Freeman played so nice and professional in this one like others that he used to play a rule. personally Speaking this Movies wanted to explain the real friendship and Loyalty between two persons or simply two friends and because of this these kinds of features made the movie more acceptable and worth watching it for that long running time,and Also good to talk about wonderful rule that Mr.Tim Robbins played in this Movies but Overall this one contains superstars and also A well known French director Mr.Frank Darabont so we convinced Why this movie got the Rate of 9.3/10 From almost 1.5 Million Users in IMDb only and I can surly say Movie Lovers have watched this Wonderful Opus in their Watch List."
880,True,"Directed by Frank Darabont, this film ticks all the boxes of what excellent films are all about. It encompasses the reality of a prison thriving on corruption among its operators as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the protagonist, struggles to serve a sentence wrongfully imposed on him. It seems the only thing helping him survive the harsh reality of prison is fellow inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) with whom he forms a special friendship. Life for Andy in a tough prison is set to last him all his life. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional roller coaster, or a tear-jerker, then this is the film for you. Great cast, excellent story-line and perfect acting. It's based on the novel written by renowned author Stephen King. So get your tissue boxes out and ice-cream because this movie is emotionally draining. Great film, 9/10. Really."
881,True,"This movie is watching worthwhile. You cannot just predict about whats going on. Really fascinating movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was outstanding. It's like I was present with them all the way. The way this movie was started and till the very end it was marvelous. I have to mansion about the dialogues used in this movie that they were truly inspiring. This movie made me think about life. Surely it can inspire ones life and can lead to greatness. Yes, it was one of the best movie that i have ever seen. Direction was quite well and cast were more then perfect. The character for Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman suits them most and I think no one can do better then them :)"
882,True,"This movie has the one thing every great movie has, and that is that the movie is tied together and all the details conform into one great story at the end. Don't get me wrong the movie was great through every scene (especially small details, like how Red sees 'Brooks was here' carved into the ceiling of the room Brooks hangs himself in), but the moment you think you'll see Andy hanging lifeless from his cell you find out that he has escaped Shawshank. In the next moments while watching you start to realize that from the first day Andy talked to Red about the pick hammer, he already has his plan in mind. And even though it seems as if Andy wants the poster of the actress while watching the film for his own pleasure, he actually used it to cover up the tunnel he dug during the years he was in Shawshank. Andy's calm demeanor when under pressure from the warden and the guards causes him to slip under their eye and dig the tunnel to escape Shawshank. That's why this is my favorite movie of all time, because the conclusion makes you realize things that were going on throughout the story that no other movie ending can even come close to how the Shawshank Redemption ends."
883,True,"I have to thank to the director, actors, screen players and the other people who made this film. -Morgan Freeman is a genius of the cinematography and stars only in very beautiful pictures. -Tim Robins plays one of the most loved characters ever. -Frank Darabont made his best film. -The storyline is one of the most interesting that I've ever seen. One of my favorite movies ever! I'm happy that this film is in top 10 but i consider that there are other films who deserve to be no. 1, but I still love this picture! I hope next generations will love this film the same way I do. Continue to make gorgeous pictures! Best wishes! B-)"
884,True,"This is a great movie I agree with it but the 1st place should be taken from other titles like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction or Apocalypse Now for example. Those films changed for some reason the way people look at the cinema nowadays. Take Pulp Fiction for example, Tarantino have created a whole universe with their movies, all the stories are connected in some way, he created cigarettes and hamburger brands that he use in all his movies, the fact that ""The Bride""(Kill Bill) is just a character played by ""Mia Wallace""(Pulp Fiction) and by the same actress(Uma Thurman). These layers, make a movie get pass by generations and still get the ""thing"" in your head every time you see it. I could talk about some other movie or director that deserve the 1st place more than this on but I have chose this example and I would like to know your opinion about it.Thanks,"
885,True,"I extremely recommend for the people who is a fan movies, The Best of The Best movies of all the Times!My first impression before watch the movie it was like"" This seems pretty bad movie, just for the photo"" but then my uncle/Godfather told me to watch, in the begin it was a little stopped the movie but then i start to enjoy , and the end is the best thing because he is very intelligent at the point he dig a hole through the wall , and put a post, and help the chief of the prison with the finances.I have watch this movie like 4 times! In a scale of 0/10 i would give 100!"
886,True,"With a legion of titles like Pet Sematary, Firewalker, Sleepwalkers, Maximum Overdrive, and Children of the Corn, it's reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion pictures. Adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable. There are a few notable exceptions, however; two of which Stand by Me, Misery were crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner. While The Shawshank Redemption is not a Reiner movie per Se, it is a production of Castle Rock Pictures Reiner's film company, and ranks among the best filmed versions of any King stories to date. This statement has not changed since I first wrote it in 1994.Spanning the years from 1947 through 1966, The Shawshank Redemption takes the ""innocent man in prison"" theme and bends it at a different angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the movie ventures down a less-traveled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars. As one of the characters puts it: ""These prison walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.""Filmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, The Shawshank Redemption is set in a place of perpetual dreariness. What little color there is, is drab and lifeless lots of grays and muted greens and blues, and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a longtime Cohen brothers collaborator. It's ironic, therefore, that the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation.First time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances. Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity. Andy's ire is internal; he doesn't rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that has imprisoned him. His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly.Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman, or ""Red"" as his friends call him, is the self-proclaimed ""Sears and Roebuck"" of the Shawshank Prison for a price, he can get just about anything from the outside. His is the narrative voice and, for once, the disembodied words aid, rather than intrude upon, the story. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red is a mixture of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed. His friendship with Andy is one of The Shawshank Redemption's highlights.William Sadler (as a fellow prisoner), Clancy Brown as a sadistic guard, and Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden all give fine supporting performances. Newcomer Gil Bellows, in a small but crucial role that was originally intended for Brad Pitt, brings the poise of a veteran to his portrayal of Tommy Williams, Andy's protégé.Ultimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving - and effective - sequences.Unfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.""Salvation lies within,"" advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic."
887,True,The movie which impressed me to watch dramatic movies a lot.It felt good when the hero escaped from the prison because he never was meant to be inside. But the real part which made me feel very intriguing was to think how much one should have been thinking about freedom that he could make his path out of the prison with just using a rock hammer over so many years.I've even let my parrot to fly high out of his cage who had always been trying to open his cage. TRUE STORY!!!FREEDOM matters!!!Morgan Freeman. He's a man beyond my judgement skills!!!
888,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is hands down one for the history books. This movie is based on the friendship of two people (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) in prison.If for some reason you are unfamiliar with this movie I'll give you a basic run-down.A guy is accused of murdering his wife and boyfriend she was cheating on him with. He is sent to jail and makes friends with one guy(Morgan Freeman) he does well and goes in charge of the library and eventually moves to the prison managers bank accountant. A few guys give him trouble and the rest is for you to find out.This film is definitely a must see. (13 years+)9/10- For incredible prison realism, plot line, movie ending.+IMDB no1. Rated movie of all time"
889,True,"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."
890,True,"In 1947 Andy Dufresne is jailed for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocent but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day it is details like this that make the film special. There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film."
891,True,"Movie is good to watch. But I wonder how did it make to no.1 position on 250..!! Lots of better movies are there..!! And also it copies some scenes form ""Escape from Alcatraz (1979)""..!!that i would give 8/10 Again am telling you that movie's climax is good..!!People already watched this movie made their ratings 10. Why all the people has made it a 10, even it hasn't any specialty..!! The movie is just an o.k movie..!! it doesn't deserve even in top 100..!!The performances are truly above average but I think that the characters are not near as memorable.I wrote this comment only to encourage people to do the ratings wise fully .Many very good movies are under rated..!!please make your sense..!!"
892,True,"It contains everything important: - tension - good story - twists - good acting It's one of those movies, you'll think about long times and wont forget. This movie shows us, that we don't always need explosions and special effects. There are just some prisoners talking about life and freedom. And its still exciting and heartbreaking. One of the reasons I became a member of this site, was to rate THIS movie. It's my favorites and I recommend it to everybody. An other reason why this film is so grate, is that the viewer only looks from the outside. He is as surprised as the other prisoners itself. But at the end everything makes sense. It's like a perfect puzzle."
893,True,"Well, it's out to be said although many have said it already, but this movies is one of the best movies that humans ever conceived. I do not think this movie is about a conman escaping or even about finding redemption in a prison cell in the common way. I think that this movie is about fighting for what's right in the face of adversity and acknowledging what you really are deep down inside. Many of the inmates knew that deep down inside they were free men, even while surrounded by high trapping walls. Maybe that's what kept them living day after another. All in all, it's a great movie that surpassed and overshadowed many other ones."
894,True,"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff.Red (Morgan Freeman)and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) are amazing actors that make this movie one of the best of all time. Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont."
895,True,"Currently I am studying Film Critics at university and I was suggest to watch and write a review on The Shawshrank Redemption. The film is about Andy told by Red, Andy's good friend at the prison called ""Shawshrank"". I must say that I'm pretty positive about this movie at the beginning because of Morgan Freeman. My expectation wasn't fail but i felt a little bored at the end. However, i thought the plot was going to be more complicated than this. The movie gives a lot of survival feeling though which makes me quite into the movie. Besides, the whole plot was very touching especially for the scene that Brook commit suicide. It seems like the guys who went in there can never find happiness when they came out. I believe this movie gives out motivation to be strong and really learn what living is really. It shows mood incredibly well for the depressed part but sometimes I find the story goes very slowly so I get bored."
896,True,"This is simply one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. It has got everything, from drama to some subtle comedy and every scene contains its own cliffhanger - once you start watching, you cannot stop until you've watched the whole movie. And once you've watched the movie once, you will want to see it again and yet again, there is no point in time this movie will bore you.Its raw genius, from the actors and to the director - everybody did an exceptional job to give this movie true character. No movie will ever surpass this movie as the best movie of all times. From the plot, one can draw some conclusions about whats going to happen, but that is irrelevant, to just follow through the story and to be able to enjoy whats being displayed is the greatest thing one can do."
897,True,"When you reach the end of this masterpiece you can't imagine that you can surrender,you to fight to the end . Here, battle is not a choice ,you have to fight otherwise you will be defeated even destroyed completely . In my life ,I think that I haven't seen such quantity of hope ,this movie made me more motivated to struggle in my life and gave me the power to face such difficult situations even impossible to solve or deal with . The whole crew, director, actors, writers,.......etc have done a great effort to make such magnificent masterpiece to inspire the people every where and every when . Finally , I hope every one enjoy the movie and learn the important lesson not to give up , never"
898,True,"This movie is based on the resilience of a guy whom had the chance to be all along his detention in the same cell, near the outer wall of the prison. Then, of course, no one thought that a wall made of mud, which conveniently doesn't make a sound when dug, wouldn't be sufficient to prevent a detainee, who has nothing else to do, to dig it in to get out.The rest of the movie is stepping up to be the masterpiece we all know and love. But this, I can't call it a flaw, but these unlikely premises really bugged me watching it. I still call it a good movie. But for it to be THE best film, on this site, is pretty far-fetched."
899,True,Best movie ever ....Shawshbk redemption.....The big lesson in this film is to wait wait wait until you get the best opportunity to get rid of any thing u want.......He has much patient to get rid from the jail..........wow awesome.......when he the rock on the pipe ...the timing was absolutely right........firstly the light came then the voice came of the storm when he was running off.............The acting of a black man (supporting role)(Morgan Freeman) was actually great......He act better then the main hero (Tim Robbins)....And although I can say about this movie is that you can do every thing what you want to if you are in right way............Thanks....... regards...
900,True,"It has long been my contention that it is the movie-maker's task to hold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent, difficult-to-follow symbolisms. That having been said, I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high- adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the viewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar. (Since Citizen Kane, at least. )Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film with the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American Film Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so myopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr. Strangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time."
901,True,"I cannot believe that it took me 17 years to see this movie and was it worth the wait well here's what the film is about.The story is about a young banker played by Tim Robbins who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in Shawnshank prison where he meets a former crook named Reed played by the brilliant actor of our generation Morgan Freeman. The two become inseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the HELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard while the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up holes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get out of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in cold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching these kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a romantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching violent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the best movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about dealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying. Overall I did enjoy this movie but I wouldn't be watching it again. Once is enough for me.SO I'm giving it a 7.5/10"
902,True,"Never has perseverance played such a strong character on film. The respect and friendship that came from it were against all odds, but to do so one would need hope. Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne manages that intangible saving grace over decades while falsely imprisoned and it's Morgan Freemans' Red who narrates for us and in constant perspective against the institutionalization of the Maine State penitentiary. The symbiotic relationship between the two is perfect cinema chemistry. The ending is quite fantasy, but makes for good afternoon drama on TNT who, I believe bought the rights for a cheep price, and that's a happy ending for Ted Turner!"
903,True,"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"
904,True,"Let me start out by stating the fact that I am a HUGE Morgan Freeman fan. I absolutely adore most of his work, however, The Shawshank Redemption is the only exception as to just how far my love of Morgan Freeman will go. First of all, in the opening scene, when Morgan is getting rubbed down by two husky white men in the shower, the hot water handle should be facing the LEFT, unless this film was shot in Canada or Utah, I see no reason for this subtle inaccuracy. Second, why did Bruce Willis decide to concentrate his fire strictly on the escapees of the prison?! Why not on the inmates that were tucked safely in their cells?! Finally, the third and final problem that I had with this movie, is this: Hadley is arrested for murder, crying like a little girl as he is taken away, while the Warden decides to shoot his brains out.While the others would talk about Andy's exploits, Red just listens. One day he receives a blank postcard from the Border, knowing that his friend made it there in one piece.Red manages to pass the next parole hearing with an angry honesty that was missing from his past meetings, and is sent to the halfway house used by Brooks. He is lost on the outside and would like to return to Shawshank, but instead he fulfills his promise to Andy, and follows his friend's plan to find the tree he mentioned, and a black box containing a wad of money and a letter.Red breaks the law to violate his parole, and takes the bus down to the border. At the end, on the beaches of Zihuatanejo, we see Andy working on a boat, about to be joined by another free man, Red. Honestly, if you're even considering watching this movie, please spend your time elsewhere. It's terrible."
905,True,"This film is no. 1 on the top 250. I would have to disagree with that. The reason why I don't think it deserves to be 1 or even 25 for that manner is...Tim Robbins acting and this might be coming from a biased point of view because I have never liked Tim Robbins in any one of his films. I have never liked him because of his slow delivery that makes him sound a little bit like Robert De Niro in Awakenings. Also another reason I don't think it deserves to be no. 1 is because of it's plot. This plot is completely unoriginal. I mean wow an African-American man and a white man become friends in pre civil-rights movement America. One of the few things I did enjoy was the whole middle part (i'll try not to give too much away.) The middle part consists of Morgan Freeman getting out of jail and searching for Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins). Also one of the few things that is fantastic about this film is the supporting acting and the Directing of this film. Overall I would put ""Shawshank"" at about 35 on this list."
906,True,"Essentially, The Shawshank Redemption is about the survival of the human spirit---in a colossally adverse situation. The brutality and corruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer right between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones of our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full display here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism and high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the narration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is now considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was released ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to mesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads needed to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all ..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from this movie are positive (me included). I do not think its a Classic------but it sure is a powerful movie ... and a very good one."
907,True,"Having not read the book initially, this movie blew me away. With such intricacy to detail and screenplay which kept the viewer gripped The Shawshank Redemption was one movie which ranks as most appealing to me.The whole time I, as a viewer, did not expect that the ending was going to be like that, to that extent. The acting was indeed superb and the way of expressing the changes in character and settings was impeccable.To reiterate to an audience what was occurring inside of the jail, and to depict changes in emotions and feeling with such clarity definitely justifies that the director of this movie was more than the average one in Hollywood.1994, 18 years ago, was when this movie was made but to the level to which it takes one is truly outstanding. One is absorbed by it, and there is no confusion about what is happening but rather thoughts in the viewers' minds about ""What is gonna happen next?"" These thoughts are present when watching a horror/ thriller movie for the most part, but for aficionados of different genres to all like this movie proves that this was one heck of a movie.Cannot miss this movie; it is one that makes one think, learn, and be entertained simultaneously."
908,True,"At the beginning when you watch the movie you will see the film was an ordinary and doesn't deserves to be the best film in cinema history, but don't be fooled by the title of the book because you don't know the content is real only when you deepening it,, because the viewer breathtaking start the story epic and heroic ""people say that old movies the best of the modern I agree with that as soon as I watched this film, but i don't always agree that it is impossible to logically ""..I was surprised in the past before I watch the film to see what all of these popular about so? ... I have started gradually discovered that when I saw a lot of details about the main story ..I raised my admiration for the story associated with some double by (andy) and that the new person who came recently to the prison, which is called (Tommy) who told the story to (Andy) about the real killer of his wife and her lover .. So it was a story I didn't hear the strangest of them before. I must say that this scene is the strangest sight I have ever seen. This is true art, to begin to describe this film as a story of hope I have some words about hope, I like to write to you, which I doubt really that it will consolidate in the mind of the reader when they hear or read (do not give up that stalled your feet and fell into a large hole claims the prison will come out of them and you are more coherent and strength to that, whatever the difficulties of life they are experiencing and if the problems and your weight on your shoulders and if you really want to change, if you want to transform your life for the better, you must demonstrate hope, whatever the circumstances that prevailed in that bright future is linked with hope!) If you are a fan of crime stories and movies that relate to imprisonment and escape from it in a way you never heard before , which will satisfy your desire when you see the film because it contains a lot of meanings powerful and sincere feelings for those looking for hope and redemption. But not in the knowledge that this film does not hold Action or any of that because everything is owned by the effects of spiritual and words from the heart and the deep connotations."
909,True,"Don't get me wrong,I loved this movie. It's a beautiful and powerful fictional story, beautifully and powerfully told. Incredible job by everyone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and never misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven forward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me somewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite films about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about Shawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving everything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his patience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow cooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it was a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our being that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which gives us great emotions but ultimately ""insults"" our common sense.Andy Dufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it. Beautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't leave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating this one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking around me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the fate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see Red and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or Heracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost perfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9."
910,True,"Most of the movie is great, but i think that the ending was bad. Dufresne telling Red about the field and Zihuatanejo makes it too to figure out that they'll both end up free and happy :) A very dramatic movie until then and with some funny catch lines from time to time. Great acting by not only Tim and Morgan but by most of the actors. The small ""stories"" besides the main one makes it great, too. The library, Red's tries to get released, the boy who had met the one who committed the crime that Dufresne was sentenced for and such things help the movie going on without making it boring. I also think that it isn't a movie that can be seen a lot of times but i'm not sure before having seen it a couple of times more"
911,True,"I can see why this movie is loved because it is moving and a great emotional experience, however #2 on the IMDb 250. Is this madness? It doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Godfather. In comparison to the Godfather lets see:1. Is it better directed than the Godfather? Not even nearly close come on this movie didn't even get a nomination while Coppola has directed a masterpiece for all time.2. Is it better Acted than the Godfather? Please Morgan Freedman vs. Brando No question and the Godfather has better supporting actors all around.3. Better Screenplay? That is a joke, Mario Puzo owns it4. Better Music? Forget about the Godfather music is famous.5. So is it all around? not a chanceAs for the movie overall, I did like it but it is good not GREAT. I found it moving and a good film for the triumph of human spirit (its not better than a flew over the cuckoo's nest either) and I found it to be a good movie. On AFI's top 100 list, it was at 72 which is a more appropriate for it. I only compared to the Godfather because the Godfather and Shawshank are in the battle for #1 when its no contest. The ending was a fairy tale too. Yeah sure people always break out of jail with a rock chipper and then move to Mexico with their pal that they met in the joint. Please."
912,True,"The direction, the acting, the writing, absolutely everything about this film is masterful.To start off with, the acting is excellent.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give what are arguably the performances of their career. Robbins acts with subtlety and understatement, speaking his lines and manipulating his body language with an effortless grace. Freeman's acting and narration are brilliant, in particular his monologue near the end.The direction is some of the best, a surprising and resounding foray into big budget films by Frank Darabont.And of course, the writing is the true shining feature. The creativity of the story, and the twists that give us the ultimate satisfaction are rarities among modern American films.This movie, is unquestionably one of the best films of the 1990s, and perhaps one of the best that has ever been made"
913,True,"I have recently watched The Shawshank Redemption. To put it simply as possible, it is a great piece of movie history.This movie deserves to be where it is (second)on the best Two hundred and fifty greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption is basically about a prisoner, who is in Shawshank prison because of a murder which he didn't commit. The prisoner is a banker called Andy dufresne. As the film shows Andy is a honest man. Andy is also a committed man. Andy is acted by Tim Robbins. Andy Dufresne makes a strong friendship with a man nicknamed Red. Red is acted by Morgan Freeman. I think this movie is on of the best I've ever seen I would rate it 9 out of 10."
914,True,"I stopped to see Shawshank when I was driving through Cincinnati. The theater was speckled with moviegoers.. all unaware of what an incredible cinematic achievement they were about to witness. There wasn't the slightest sound from the audience....they were mesmerized. The Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic performances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a spectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's audience in tears of happiness. The narration from Freeman is written with care and this film is crafted and paced with a precision that Hollywood hasn't seen in a long, long, time. ""I hope to see the Pacific...I hope it is as blue as it is in my dreams"". This film addresses many moral trust issues....from being raped in jail, to finding a friend amongst criminals, to being unjustly incarcerated and then shunned when you prove your innocence..""how could you be so obtuse?"".....in the end it is the simplest thing, friendship, that is synonymous with freedom. This was the last time I was in a theater that cheered at the credits....and the only time an audience...so small in numbers...ever did that. One of my top 5 favorite films of all-time. 98/100"
915,True,"I just saw this movie for the first time. My daughter watched it first when she was 12 when it first came out. She went on and on about it saying how great it was then in about 1995. She also loved ""Trading Places"". I guess the moral of both of these stories is that the good guys win in the end. I now know what she was talking about. It is a great movie, and I can see why it appeals to women.The movie is set in a prison, with the time old tradition of a close friendship over many years of an innocent young man as the hero and an ""old lag"" who knows all the ropes, in this case Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. This is the same formula earlier used in the films ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and ""An Innocent Man"", both films which are highly recommended, if you liked this one.The film, although made in 1994, goes back to a time when good wins out over evil. unfortunately the fashion for a long time in the nineties movies was for bad to win out, as in ""the Terminator"" and other movies. The bad guys are as usual the prison boss, The Warder and his Second in Command, the Uniformed Chief Officer. There is a highly unusual twist at the end of the movie, in which the good guys win out. This is a highly improbable situation, but fantasy is allowable in movies. One character of note is that of an old man, played by James Whitmore, who rescues a tiny bird, and nurtures it for years. Thank goodness it doesn't get killed by some other evil person, as usually happens. The old man has to cope with pressures in the outside after he is released.The overarching theme of the movie is one of hope. No matter how bad things get, there is always hope that thing will get better. It also shows that it is possible to have a friendship between black and white people, as the older man, the main character's friend, is a black man. The thing that this movie gave me, is that I can see how wise my daughter already was at 12 years of age, and more importantly, it gives hope and a good philosophy for the rest of my life. I'm sure that it will do the same for those of you who see this movie too.I am unsure as to whether it deserves to be rated the best movie of all time. However movies with hope and goodness as their main themes are generally up there, take ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" as examples of this."
916,True,"The Shawshank Redemption is by far the best movie I've seen in my life. It has it all. The acting is superb and that is not just a complement every single actor that appears in this movie gave probably the best acting that they could give. The story is very rough and hard, being life in prison and all, and yet it's touching, you see the leading character, Andy, never giving up, sticking to his story even when the world seems to turn its back on him. Inside He finds that hope is the only thing that's gonna make him go on, wake up everyday. Very nice message that the movie gives you. Also the way the friendships works, the commitment, the way they stick together and help each other, very beautiful, very beautiful. So great directing, great story, great acting, EXCELLENT MOVIE! Make yourselves a favor and go rent this movie, I promise it won't let you down."
917,True,"This is in my opinion, tied with Goodfellas for the greatest ever made. Masterfully conceived and directed by Frank Darabont, a powerfully adapted story from Stephen King's short story, amazing acting, and one of the best musical scores ever written made this movie one of the handful of masterpieces that will never die. Along with Goodfellas losing Best Picture, choosing Forest Gump(a great movie) over the Shawshank Redemption was the biggest mistake they ever made. The movie that makes many references to redemption and hope is like Jesus himself. The film did poorly in the box office but has enjoyed one of the greatest afterlives in the history of cinema.Plot: The story is taken from Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" and Frank Darabont made one of the only movies better than the source material. Masterfully crafted to start with a depressing image of everything the film goes to make one of the most uplifting, happy, and powerful endings in the history of film.Acting: Narrating is Morgan Freeman who gives an Oscar-Worthy performance as Red a lifer for murder in The Shawshank State Prison. Tim Robbins likewise gives a powerful performance as the sympathetic Andy Dufresne a lifer for murder as well. Playing the cold and ruthless Mr. Norton the Warden is Bob Gunton who creates one of the greatest villains I've ever seen on screen.Quality: This film is one of the greatest ever. One of the things that really made this film was probably one of the best, most uplifting and powerful musical scores I've ever heard which also deserved an Oscar. The camera work was also fantastic opening with a sky-view of the prison.This is one of the few movies where if you don't see the genius of it I will have to question if you really seen the entire film or any of the film. This is along with Goodfellas the greatest movies ever. There are only a handful of masterpieces in history and this is one of them. Even less is the amount of films that will never die and will always stand the test of time. This is one of them. This is a film that you should just buy.11/10"
918,True,"The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an educated banker sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Andy inspires his fellow inmates with his courage and humanity and has a profound effect on Red (Morgan Freeman), an older prisoner, who has given up hope.Unlike many films of the 90's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has ""high concept"" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight, linear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom in the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine surprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot points. In hindsight, we tend to forget how successfully director Frank Darabont leads us to expect a very different resolution.""The Shawshank Redemption"" does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There's a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.These two distinct worlds are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison, they are no longer watching a movie, but they are also feeling it.This is a movie that will remain a favorite of the people for many decades to come. 10/10"
919,True,"The greatness of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is all the great values this film is built on - love, friendship, lending hand to another man. What is also wonderful about this film is its combination of its serious moments with the beautiful humour. In addition, the film has a third-person narrator which adds a lot of meaning to it and allows to develop a closer relationship with Red and - through Red - with Andy. As for Stephen King's story that the film is based on, it a bit disappointed me. However, after reading it I appreciated Frank Darabont's work even more - I saw how much imagination and creativity he had to use for ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Lastly, the score is so beautiful you can cry at moments, e.g. the piece accompanying the arrival of Andy's transport to the Shawshank Prison. I guess I watched this movie five times and think I will watch it many times more. I recommend it to everyone."
920,True,"*The Shawshank SPOILERS* In the early '20s, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quiet bank employee, is arrested, tried and sentenced to life in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover, murders that he didn't commit.The calm man has to rough up really soon, in order to survive life in the Shawshank prison, but manages to develop a friendship with a fellow inmate called Red (Morgan Freeman) and to be employed in the contability office by the corrupt director of Shawshank, thus helping his escape plan...When I first watched this movie, a few years ago, I was so in awe that as soon as I got out of school (where me and my classmates watched it during a morning without teachers) I went and bought it.It's an instant classic, an inspiring movie, based upon a short story by Stephen King (!), marvelously written, acted and directed, and fully deserving of being owned.The Shawshank Redemption: 10/10."
921,True,"I am totally puzzled as to why this film is so highly rated. It is reasonably well made, has a very good cast, and it held my interest. However, it has nothing new in it. It wasn't fun. It wasn't life changing. It didn't make me want to be a better person. None of the characters in the film were particularly appealing. The protagonist's method for escaping from prison was obviously not new, since he flashed his copy of ""The Count of Monte Christo."" There was an unusual directness in confronting gay rape in prison, but I find it to be not that compelling a subject. I guess that leaves redemption. To me, he paid way too high a price for thinking about, but not actually, killing his wife. After she cheated on him. Perhaps the point was that he felt so guilty about her death, he wanted to be punished. By spending twenty years getting raped in prison? That's not punishment, it's just sick."
922,True,This is definitely the best film I've ever seen.Ever What pulled me in is how much you start to feel for these characters as if their real people. Another thing that I liked is how the characters change for example Andy(main character) at the start hes a healthy looking man and after 20 years he has grey hairs bags under his eyes and a broken spirit.In the end you don't care what happens to the warden you don't care if he becomes president as long as Andy escapes.In truth this is a love story but not a regular love story this is A story of two of the most unlikely candidates.There's Andy a hardworking lawyer and then there's red sent to prison at the age of 18 for murder and armed robbery two polar opposites but in the end they might as well be family.This is the single most powerful movie ever at the end I was crying something that has never happened before anyway this is a film to see before you die words cant honestly explain how great this film is you have to see it.
923,True,"I do think some films get better the more you view them. ""Shawshank"" is such a film. Whever I stumble across it on a cable channel, I am simply unable to break away from it, even though I've seen it a dozen times. The best films are ""simple stories, well told."" From the script, to the acting, to the direction, to the sets, and - most importantly - in its message, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is absolutely first-rate. It's always fun to see a wronged man win in the end, but in this story it is the manner in which Andy prevails that is so gripping. The scene in which Tim Robbins as Andy ponders if he is in some way responsible for his fate because of his thoughts is amazing. And Morgan Freeman's greatest film moment comes when he faces the parole board one more time. Most movies blow from your mind minutes after the final credits, this one stays with you forever. I'm ready to see it again."
924,True,"*spoilers*The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"",I was simply blown away by how powerful this movie is. There are no action sequences or romances, but the subtle drama of a man who is wrongly accused is easily identifiable, possibly because we realize that it could happen to anyone. What makes the main character (Andy Dufrene) find the strength to survive his term of life in prison is his knowledge of his innocence, and his friendship with Red, a convicted murderer, who is slowly reforming throughout the movie. The end of the movie is perhaps one of the most uplifting scenes I have ever watched, as justice finally prevails, due to Andy's determination and careful planning.I never get tired of this movie. From the beginning of the movie where Andy considers murder, to his incarceration for that same murder(ironically committed by someone else), and his long stay in prison under a cruel warden, and finally the best-ever use of a Raquel Welch art poster. Ever.I highly encourage this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is a classic, and the acting is superb. Even smallest roles are memorable."
925,True,"A heartbreaking story fraught with Passion, Loss, A Dream, and Friendship. There's only so much i can say about a film that is loved by millions and yet misunderstood by more. It's the visual version of a musical ballad. A soft and thoughtful piece and yet created by a hard centre and churned by the brilliant hands of Frank Darabont and the great acting of both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A True Classic.""Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realises there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomises why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. Will Andy ever realise his dreams...?"""
926,True,"This film really got me. As soon as Morgan Freeman got into the movie, I started to get interested and the film ended up to be a crowd cheer and a tearjerker. The story is so well done. This movie is based on Stephen Kings short novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.""Vice president of the Portland bank Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) goes to jail for two life sentences he did not commit. When he goes to jail, the first step onto the prison ground will change his life. When he's been beaten around by the queer bull Diamond brothers, he decides to wait a few years to escape. Before these years he decides to meet the institutionalized prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) who can get Andy or other prisoners whatever they wanted. He can get you packs of cigarettes, jack hammers, naked lady cards, and posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe etc. Andy wanted a jack hammer to crack his wall. Red promised Andy that if the guards find his hammer, they will never do business again. Andy never got caught and Red and him both became friends for a long time. Andy became a big hit for the prisoners and the guards when he helped them with their tax problems. In exchange he got the prisoners beers. After he got the prison library to expand. That is most of what I can say about 'The Shawshank Redemption.'Why did this film not win any academy awards? I felt this film was a lot better than the brutally charged 'Pulp Fiction' than Tom Hanks life achievements as 'Forrest Gump.' This picture sees life more beautifully and more possible. This is a great luminous character study of fortitude and friendship behind bars at its finest."
927,True,"I saw this movie at the end of a particularly bad and miserable day in my life and it is safe to say that I was not particularly looking forward to this one.Two and a half hours later I was on my feet again and was once more prepared to look the world in the eyes. Such is the power of this movie.Tim Robbins plays a sincere man who is sent to to jail for a crime he did not commit. Inside, he meets extraordinary human beings, all of who you will fall in love with within minutes of meeting them. Chief among these is the character of Red, played by none other than the legendary Morgan Freeman.Together with Andy and Red you learn about life and friendship and the evils inherent in human nature. You laugh with them, are sad with them and feel their pain, and in the end, when the two friends meet again on a remote beach years later, you finally break down and cry with them.This movie is emotionally powerful and reminds us once again what the movies should be.It is not sentimental in any way, and that is a rarity these days. And if you do not feel sad, and your heart does not beat faster with Morgan Freeman's soliloquoy at the end, you cannot call yourself human. For, then, you have missed one of the greatests gifts one can receive: a passion for life."
928,True,"Best movie ever made. From the beginning to the end this movie is so perfect it's hard to put it into words, every little detail is stunning. Maybe my opinion is not the most objective because this has been my favorite movie for quite some time, but however, I remembered the first time I saw it. I could't get it of my mind for a couple of days. And still, after seeing it over 20 times, I often think about it and smile. The part when Andy escapes and the next 30 minutes after that you can't stop smiling, it's so perfect. The biggest star must go to Morgan Freeman who gives this movie even more deep and feeling. To everyone who haven't seen it yet, do it, you will not regret it."
929,True,"This for me is the best movie of all time because it shows companionship through out the movie between the two main characters (andy and red). It's true to life with the little details of when it was set and the story was genius, great twist at the end when he reveals the hole in the wall, great stuff, your rooting for Andy the whole time as we all know he is innocent. He gets his revenge in the end by out smarting the person who over looks the prison, which for me is the best part of the movie. The three sister also shine a light on how desperate in mates can get, and Red shows the craft of an experienced prisoner smuggling small goods for the rest, he takes Andy under his wing and tells him moral after moral. Great movie, i can watch it over and over again, which, normally i cant with most long movies, but this is one movie that is something that little extra special. Watch it!!!!"
930,True,"***SPOILERS***This is a great movie that shows us that hope is a great thing. The story tells us about Andy Dufrense, a man who is falsely accused for killing his wife and her lover and who gets sent to Maines strongest prison. Shawshank. In Shawshank Andy gets new friends, as well as enemies. Being the wise man that he is, he begins to inject wisdom in people. Helping them. He also meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. A man also accused for murder, but on true accusations. They become great friends and together they give themselves hope. This is a wonderful movie that leaves you happy and shaken. Its an must see."
931,True,"I read this novella in Stephen Kings ""Four Seasons"" while i was doing my GCSE exams. i remember then what a profound effect the story had on me. A story of hope through extreme adversity and the power of friendship that i thought could not be found between two men. The sheer anticipation of this film being released was almost heart stopping, but coupled with the fear it would not live up to my expectations. i also remember thinking that i did not want to see it for fear of it shattering my own perceptions of the two main characters, ANDY and RED. i need not have feared a thing.....the screenplay and adaptation was done with nothing short of pure brilliance. the camera work and choice of location could not have been more suitable. perhaps it is a symbol of how well Mr King writes that, it seems, everyones picture of everything is the same!!! Thus is was quite easy to choose sets, locations and of course actors. In the book, RED is a white, Irish man......against all odds, i cannot imagine ANYONE else delivering such a captivating, believable and utterly brilliant performance as Morgan Freeman. This man deserves 20 Oscars his acting together with the small stabs of narration are mind blowing who else could have done this?!! NO-ONE!! Tim Robbins IS ANDY!....his whole movement and attitude were exactly what King had written, this was encompassed in Robbins' portrayal perfectly. together the chemistry they had was beautiful, you could see that these characters were good friends, as well as the actors that played them. The visionary pieces of the film that will always linger? well the whole film lingers, such was the effect it had on me, but the two specific points in the film? Firstly, Andy described to RED where he could find a box, near a tree in a field, under some rocks to be exact. Now this bit is in the book (obviously!!) but i remember when i read it, the picture of that tree, in that field, next to that wall. In the film it was as if they had asked ME to choose the location, a chill went down my spine and it nearly brought me to tears!!! and i am NOT KIDDING!!!!. The second bit, well its right at the end, its the smile on RED's face when he sees ANDY again. This is not a feeble lip turning grin.....NO this is a full , both sets of teeth, cheek aching smile!!!! it IS the biggest and most emotional smile i have ever seen in any film. i could go on for pages about this film, i have been a film fan ever since i can remember, sitting with my father on a Sunday afternoon (before the times of VCR's or satellite, when you watched what was on that day or tough!!!) we watched films like ""The African Queen"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Rear Window"", etc and from then i always liked a good film with a good story, The Shawshank Redemption was already a good story, it took genius to make it a GREAT film. to date i have seen it over 100 times. this has taken me through 3 copies on Video before the DVD came out, i am now on my 2nd DVD. if i have to buy another 100 DVD's it will always always alway be my number one favourite film of all time. It is a film you can watch at any time, when you are in any mood and it is still as compelling as the first time i saw it, or indeed the first time i read the story. 20 out of 10........"
932,True,"In the 11 years since the release and realization of the brilliance of this film, I'm sure many, many legions of people have written reviews that summarily praise (and viscously, ignorantly degrade - you know who you are, those whose reviews appear under the ""hated"" tag on the reviews pages) and criticize the movie. I can't add anything that hasn't been said before, except just say how much this movie affected me and how much I love it. Tim Robbins, always a great actor, and always very, very human. Morgan Freeman, c'mon, who da man? Who da MAN?!?!? HE DA MAN!!! He DA MAN!!! He DA smooth-walkin', smoother-talking', illest muthaf***in' epitome of ""cool"". And not a bad actor, either, heh heh (yes, I know I am drastically understating that fact). The direction - flawless. Every shot, every camera angle, every color tone (plus the quality of the film and the cameras themselves) embody such finesse, such power. Humanity! That's what the word I was looking for, the word that describes what every frame overwhelmingly emanates, even during the ""brutal"" scenes (I put ""brutal"" in quotes because I unfortunately have seen plenty of sick s@%* in my life and am now sadly desensitized to movie violence; violence on the news and in real life though, DAMN I get sickened and angered at perpetrators). The very human friendship twixt the leads are very well handled, never turning into cutesy schmaltz or soap-y melodrama. The writing. Yes, I know. ""How the hell does his cell open up into a pipe drain? That's horrible plot!!!!!!"" Ask yourselves: If his cell wall didn't open up over the pipe, would he have escaped? Would the story have been the same AT ALL if his cell opened up anywhere else other than that river of s@%*? And then think about Andy. Would someone of his intelligence would have discontinued his digging and succumbed to madness if what he saw when he looked through the initial tiny hole on the other side was anything other than a road to freedom? Convenient plot twist? Sure! But not outlandish. It could happen (not like a New York Cop winning a $4M lottery ticket and tipping a waitress half, no matter how much he wanted to get with her). Very good storytelling and very tight screen writing. This movie is great. Plain and simple. It did confirm one thing in general to me, though, especially in these times of moral conflict that is dividing the ""greatest nation on the face of the earth"" bitterly: Those who thump the bible the hardest, usually cling to it the hardest out of fear and out of guilt. Love this film."
933,True,"This is simply a film that you would struggle to find a flaw with. The performances are wonderful, the story is involving and deep, the characters are likable and understandable, and the whole climax to the story is satisfying and rewards you for having stayed the course. It's funny, it's moving, and it presents an incredible perception on the ideas of hope, freedom and the vibrancy of the human spirit.If you haven't seen this film yet, then go out, rent a copy, and watch it. If you have a friend who hasn't seen it either, then invite them round - believe me, they'll thank you for it. This is one film that really is a must-see."
934,True,"Another non-award winning movie that is consider one of the best movies ever made I loved this movie and can watch it over all the time Should have one best picture not just one brilliant but two brilliant performances by both Tim and Morgan this movie is great can,t say that enough but ill hold off if you haven't seen this movie your not a movie lover you don't know what your missing kind of like the fugitive in a sense but better another wrongly convicted person and treated horrible in prison pulls off a brilliant exit and learns a few things while in the pen underrated at the time now its rated under a movie it should be above a must watch movie."
935,True,"After seeing The Shawshank Redemption on television, I knew I had to see the whole film. It was incredible. After that I decided to read the book, and this is one of the rare times that a film outdid the book it was based off of. Even though the ending of the book was the same (poster, escape), the film just had a certain something to it that made it amazing. Tim Robbins ad Andy is extremely captivating and he almost entirely becomes the roll of a nobody. Not just any actor can do that. I can watch this movie time and time again and to me it will never get old. The music, dialouge, acting, and plot are award-deserving parts of a film that should go down in history as a classic."
936,True,"Very good movie that tells a good story.Life in early 1900's prison builds some strong friendships among the inmates. Daily prison existence takes its toll on you so you do what you have to in order to make it through. Inmates learn how to make the corruption work in their favor and take full advantage of it by building on the trust the guards have in the inmates.I don't think they could have come up with a better ending to the story than what they did. This movie is a masterpiece that you will find yourself watching any time you are in the mood for a good movie.Highly recommended film. Watch it, you will be pleased."
937,True,The only way to summarize The Shawhank Redemption is with one word Incredible. This movie is beautifully told and magically shown on the screen. It will bring a tear to your eye and fill you with hope. Andy Dufresne is convicted murderer. He has to spend two life terms in Shawshank state prison. There he gets brutally gang raped and meets many friends including Red the guy who can get things. If you have never seen this movie then you must be crazy. This may be a prison movie but the only crime is if you don't watch it. I strongly advice you to see this movie especially if you are having hard times this will make you feel and think so much better. You have to see this movie!!! Andy triumphs over adversity in this heartwarming movie of love and friendship.
938,True,"Absolute travesty that it lost the Oscar to feel-good trash like Forrest Gump.I like the fact that the Shawshank Redemption didn't bother tying up the loose end of the 'real' murderer remaining free. It was sufficient for Andy that he knew he did not commit the murders. He lived his life for the future, not for the past.There is something very touching about the scene where Andy does some financial work for one of the warders, and all the prisoners get beer as a result. He just sits back and smiles - and his unselfish act has such excellent consequences for him, both with his relations with the other prisoners, the 'sisters' and the guards."
939,True,"This is simply the greatest film ever made. when you see this movie it will take to a place of where it is not just a movie but the greatest story ever told and some amazing directing by Frank Darabont, the acting is also great and it stays strong for the whole movie. This movie deals with personal encounters and problems the characters will face, on top of that it contains unforgettable dialog and some moments you will never forget, you will be truly moved by this movie and will wish it will never end. because this is my favorite movie of all time it was not hard to get in that place because of how great it was, i thought it was even better than the classic ""The Godfather"". this is a movie i will recommend to everyone who like movies movies because trust me you will love this.Morgan Freeman in my opinion is one of the greatest actors and has only won an Oscar for his work in Clint Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"". I thought he should have won and ward here and for ""Driving Miss Daisy"". He has just recently been in the thrilling ""Batman Begins"" which the best out of the ""Batman"" franchise. Tim Robbins is a varied actor, I'm not saying his movies are either good or bad, what I'm saying is he can play any role like in ""Bull Durham"" he plays a cocky baseball player and in ""Mystic River"" he plays a disturbed family man. But when you see Freeman and Robbins together on screen it is something very special and in this situation it creates the greatest film of all time.Frank Darbont, the man behind ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Majestic"" wrote and directed this wonderful film adapted from the Stephen King Novela ""Rita Hayorth and the Shawsank Redemtion"". This is the best adapted King book, only a few others are that good, Stanley Kubricks thrilling adaptation of ""The Shinig"" and Darbonts ""The Green Mile"". frank Darabont does not drag on anything in this movie because not once did I get bored, you may think that there is not much that goes on in this movie but there is always something that is happening. At the beginning you think that Andy(Robbins) will not be able to last the first night, and you see Red(Freeman) and his friends making bets on who will freak out, to their surprise it is the fatty who freaks and Hadley beats him over the head which ends up killing him. After this Andy knows he is going to have to stand up for himself, he quickly becomes friends with Red but enemies with Heywood. Heywood and his friends would beat on Andy because he is the new guy. I wont say anything else about the movie because I don't want to give any spoilers. 10/10"
940,True,"I didn't see this movie in the theaters when it came out. I had never been a big Steven King fan, and it just didn't catch my imagination. A friend brought the video over one night for us to watch it, and MAN! I was blown away. The theme of the movie is hope, and what hope, and the lack thereof, does to people. This is truly one of the most uplifting films which I think was ever made.I thought that everything in the film clicked. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the music, all were perfect. I have read some posts where people don't like the ending, but I think the regressing shot of the two friends is right on; you see the culmination of the struggle to be free for both men, yet it's not in your face sappy.As far as the best scene, I would have to say it's a three way toss-up:1: The aria scene 2: Brook's suicide 3: Red in the wheat fieldI probably pull the DVD out once a month or so to watch this gem. JRW"
941,True,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time.How do I know this is it with so many other good movies out there? I thought along before I came to the conclusion. My basis..every time, yes, every time the movie is on T.V. I stop and watch it and love every minute of it over and over.I still get tears in my eyes when the movie ends. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are wonderful in the movie.I think everyone knows but this is one of those rare movies that was really good that is based on a Stephen King book.This is a must see feel good movie!"
942,True,"Currently, on the IMDb top 250 Movies of All Time list, the top two movies both hold ratings of 9.0. Of these two, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has roughly twenty thousand more votes in its favor. Ergo, I do believe that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" should finally ascend to its rightful place on this web-page, and hopefully cinema history, as the Greatest Film of All Time. That having been said, I wish now to give my own thoughts on this film, thoughts which will be hitherto corrupted by myriad spoilers.The acting is astounding. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the perfect combination of hope and despair, so that you can love his character without ever truly knowing what he shall do next. Morgan Freeman brings subtlety and depth to a character who would perhaps otherwise be much simpler. Bob Gunton allows you to genuinely fear Warden Norton, and if James Whitmore's performance does not make you lachrymose, nothing can.The plot is beautiful, describing the redemption of many an inmate. Red, though he does not escape institutionalization, becomes a good man. Tommy Williams does the same. The best of all endings however, is Andy's, as he goes through so much to come out clean in the end, something expressed both allegorically throughout the story and literally at the end.The greatest film I have ever seen."
943,True,"There are some movies that come along that truly make a difference in cinema and in peoples lives. In my opinion, this is one of those films.***spoilers*** (minor)The movie is about a man wrongfully accused of a crime. He is sentenced to life in prison. He ends up at Shawshank. A prison with a lot more going on than what shows on the outside.There are quite a few things that make this film a masterpiece. One is the story and its qualities and values. Another is its amazing acting by all cast members in the film. The music was great and the cinematography is creative. I don't believe there's a flaw in this movie.11/10 haha!"
944,True,"Morgan Freeman as Red was truly inspired (even if the original story had a white guy), they even used his son for the photo of the inmate as a young man...Tim Robbins as Andy DuFresne was marvelous understatement, Clancy brown as the on/off guard-friend of Andy was a good touch and a boost for his career apart from Starship Trooper... Now, Clancy is in HBO's ""Carnivale"" series and has his own website! As for the warden and ""sisters,""  they were equally well-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may not nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and retribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial head is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge saved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough! This picture is second after ""Casablanca""!!"
945,True,"Overall, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. Frank Darabont's masterful screenplay rendering of Stephen King's marginal novella brought every possible human emotion into play. And, every actor in the film did a superb job of translating this fiction into a believable reality.On a scale from 1 to 100, I'd rate this movie a solid 99. Only one thing was lacking in the film to raise that score to 100 ... but this is just a personal thing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOWS:During his time in prison, Andy Dufresne learns the identity of the man who killed his wife - a man named Elmo Blatch. And, he learns enough information about Blatch to render him ""trackable"" by an investigator. If 2 brief scenes had been added to the film, I'd have rated it a perfect film:ADDED SCENE #1 - Shortly before his escape, Andy is seen talking to another inmate who gives him contact info for a person on the outside who does contract murder.ADDED SCENE #2 - Shortly before Red's release from prison, we see him reading a newspaper story on the murder of an ex-con named Elmo Blatch.Between the time of Andy's escape and Red's release, there would have been ample time for Andy to hire a private eye to track down Blatch and, afterward, hire a contract killer to kill him. Had I been Andy, I'd not have felt truly free of the suffering I'd endured in prison unless I knew the real killer got his just due. What Andy did to the Warden and Hadley is all well and good. But Blatch's death would settle all scores once and for all."
946,True,"I first saw this movie when Channel 4 showed it in the UK in September 2001. I had just come back from a wonderful holiday in Ohio, USA and had never heard of this movie before. I just happened to flick to channel 4 and caught a glimpse of Morgan Freeman watching Tim Robbins make his entrance into Shawshank. I had missed the opening scene with the court case. My first impressions was that this was going to be a typical prison drama but I reached for the TV guide and read more about it. It starred Morgan Freeman who I remember from Along Came a Spider and Deep Impact and Tim Robbins who I have heard of but never seen on screen before. The TV guide gave it a good rating and review so I thought i might continue to watch it.In the opening scenes, I predicted possible rivalries between Andy and Heywood, however I was glad this was not the case as both characters became well-liked throughout the film. I even thought there would be tension between Andy and Red, but I was delighted that they became best friends throughout the movie. Along the way, I found the movie becoming interesting with many plots running alongside each other and beautiful photography. I held my breath when Hadley almost threw Andy off the roof and Morgan Freeman's story telling was first rate. Another scene that moved me was Andy playing the Mozart record and giving hope to all prisoners in Shawshank. I even went out to buy the fantastic soundtrack with the song as well as the superb score by Thomas Newman. I must say I was concerned when Andy got in trouble for that stunt, as I thought eventually the warden was going to help him solve his case. All the characters gave memorable performances and I was moved by Brooks taking his own life as he couldn't cope on the outside. I was shocked when Tommy revealed Andy's innocence and equally curious when the warden refused to help him. Nothing prepared me for the way Andy escaped, I was so glad he did but felt for Red at the same time. I was thrilled when Red got his parole and just hoped he didn't feel institutionalised like Brookes. I thought Red blew it when he talked up to the parole board but had a chuckle when he finally left Shawshank. Other moving scenes were Red reading Andy's letter and making his way through the fields surrounded with grasshoppers. The scene that took my breath away the most, was the shot of the bus as it made its way along the road with the brilliant sunlight, it looked just like the area where I had just come from in Ohio, as well as Red and Brookes in Main Street, Mansfield which I recognised. This film is long, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me, it is a movie you wish would go on for a bit more longer. I was stunned at the end, very moved, very happy and almost in tears. This film is truly a work of art, probably the finest movie ever made with superb acting from all of the characters, beautiful music, cinematography and so much better than the novel it is based on. I cannot believe it did not win any Oscars despite many nominations. It gives the viewer a sense of hope, happiness and satisfaction all in one and anyone can see this movie whatever mood they are in. The movie is also funny, who can forget Hadley with his, ""if I hear anything more than a mousefart..."" or Tommy explaining when he got arrested and had to drop a TV set. This movie makes you feel great to be alive and as Red says this movie is ""so beautiful it cannot be expressed in words"". I bought the DVD for my family to watch and their stunned silence at end confirmed my suspicions that they loved this movie too.Shawshank Redemption is going to be re-released in the UK in September and I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it before to go and see it and hopefully feel the same way I felt when I first saw this movie. There is so much to appreciate about this movie and everytime I see it again, I love it even more."
947,True,"No wonder this movie is on second place in the top 100 movies here on imdb.com This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and i still haven't met anyone who doesn't love it as much as i do. And if i do i will probably look at them funny and ask what is wrong with them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in this ""innocent man wants his freedom"" movie. This film is about friendship, freedom and justice. A man is sent to Shawshank prison for something he didn't commit. Here he meets a man who will become his best friend. They stick up for each other against the corrupt prison system and other inmates. You really have to see it to understand how fantastic this movie is. I rate this movie 10"
948,True,"Before you start reading my comments on this movie, please keep in mind there are very minor spoilers, so if you haven't seen it.what are you thinking, go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.
This is the first time I've written a comment about a movie on this website, but I think it will be my first of many as I have so many favourite movies I love to share my opinion about on the message boards.I only just stumbled across 'The Shawshank Redemption' about a year ago, I had noticed it was ranked number 2 and thought I'd give it ago. I've heard people talking about it and how great it is, so I bought the movie and I watched it. I admit that I had to watch it twice before I fell in awe of this movie, but now it's become one of my favourites.This movie is about hope. There is nothing set in stone. Someone may be able to take away everything you have in life, but whatever you think, whatever you feel they can never take away your thoughts, they can never take away your hope and that's what happened with Andy. He may have sunk to the bottom of the hole, but he never gave up hope that he would get out.
This is a true masterpiece and it is well written, well acted, well directed, well it's just brilliant. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman produce a great friendship in this movie. It may not have won the Oscars, as it lost to another great movie, but it certainly left an imprint in the movie world and to me.One more thing, watch out for James Whitmore as Brooks, he's sure to break your heart and move you to a place you don't go too often.
Remember, if you didn't like it the first time, give it another chance and watch it again, I promise you, you won't be disappointed you will notice little things and the scenes that you have overlooked. It's sure to turn your head and mesmerize you."
949,True,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. SpoilersIn many ways, I am more than a little shocked at the overwhelming popularity of The Shawshank Redemption. I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad film, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would appeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over 112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250 list. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see the film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting, Cinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont and he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect choice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There is only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.
Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a strong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is effective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast. All of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James Whitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves mention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the perfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He creates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses of the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.
I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at times. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a well-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This happens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the only times when the slow pace interferes with the film.
While I do not think the film deserves its high spot on the 250 list, it is a compelling and moving film. Shawshank does enough things right to overlook its sluggish ending. I recommend the film to everyone."
950,True,"When i went to see this movie, i expected boring crap, and came out from the theaters with glaced eyes and thougt, best film in history. (Im 19) the movie has it all, GREAT acting, great directing, great(and so on) The one thing that could pull this movie down is the ending,*Spoiler*>>>they shoud never have joined up again at the very end, to audience friendly.9/10
[Sorry for any bad english]"
951,True,"(very minor spoilers) I had to add this to my previous comment after reading a more recent review here on IMDb. The review stated that Christian fundamentalists hated the movie because it showed the true hypocrisy of the Warden, along with his oft quoted Bible and the stitched verse on his wall ""Judgment cometh..."" behind which he kept his ill gotten gains. But I am a Christian conservative who loved this movie for that very reason. It shows that God looks at the heart. The Warden had a wicked heart, regardless of what came out of his mouth and what he hung on his wall - and clearly his judgment did come! Andy was kind at heart, offering friendship and help to any who would accept it, and well, he got what he deserved in the end. When Red gave up trying to pretend something before the parole board, trying to tell them what they wanted to hear and instead just spoke the truth, he gets his parole. Both Andy and Red refuse to give in to the despair of prison life - instead doing what they can to bring a bit of beauty to the prison. Andy never loses his humanity, and helps Red find his again. They keep hoping till the very end, but don't just sit around waiting for justice, but actively seek it. The ending makes the movie.My husband will not watch it - having a strong aversion to ""prison flicks"" but I have seen it several times, and reading some of these comments has made me want to see it again.It is one of my all time favorite movies - I never get tired of watching it since I went out and bought the DVD. The first 30-45 minutes are full of heavy language and prison violence, but that only makes the contrast between those who have given up their humanity and those who have held onto it. Not appropriate for young children, but for those able and willing to look at the reality of life - it is beautiful!"
952,True,"The Shawshank Redemption (1994/Frank Darabont) **** out of ****""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.""- Red (Morgan Freeman)This is the ultimate story of friendship. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young hot-shot banker who is railroaded for a double murder in 1947. He is then sent to Shawshank Prison, where he soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man 'who can get things'. The movie spans almost 20 years, and shows the growing friendship of these two men. Joining them is the old pro James Whitmore as Brooks, who does a great job as a man who ""lives in fear"". This is the best ""feel good"" movie of all time, and one of the best of the 90's. It is flawless in a departments. It is based on a short story by Stephen King, and is masterfully put onto the big screen. Freeman turns in his best performance, and has many great lines as the stories narrator. In fact, the film is well written and projects deep meanings of triumph and hope. Many critics have complained that the film is too long. Whomever truly believes this can not call themselves a film critic. The film is slowly paced to show the long growing friendship of Andy and Red. It's pacing is what makes it so real and excellent.SPOILERS: The ending is the best part of the film, and has probably the best scene in motion picture history: Andy's Escape. The film's music plays a big part in this scene, showing Andy's determination and endurance. You end up rooting for him all the way. Another great scene is when Andy talks to Red after he gets out of the ""hole"". Red reveals his weaknesses and fears, but Andy has hope.This film is a masterpiece of story telling, and should not be missed. Like I said in the beginning of the review, not only is the film flawless in all departments, it excels in every way. You will believe in hope.-30-"
953,True,"Most viewers do not want to go to overly ""artsy"" movies because usually they try too hard to be intellectually stimulating but fail miserably because it is a difficult feat to pull off.  Movies like American Beauty and Amélie are few and far between.  And then there's The Shawshank Redemption: simple, honest, without pretense.  It appeals to the viewers heart and soul and not his/her head.  No one cares if the prison conditions are 100 percent believable.  It's fiction for a reason!  I never even noticed the clichés until I read a detailed post describing them, and frankly, I'm content to ignore them.  The spinner bait that hooked me on this movie was the relationship between Andy and Red.  Watching this movie for the first time (and dozens of times since) I found these two characters to be two of the most likeable characters I could think of.    The climax of this movie is in my top five of all time (TSR, Memento, Usual Suspects, Se7en, The Manchurian Candidate).  In general, people like happy endings.  I am a big fan of tragedies like The Deer Hunter and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but I cannot watch them continually with the same emotion.  Watching Shawshank for the Xth time, I experience the same emotional roller coaster as the first time viewed it. People dislike the fact that so many people give this movie a 10/10 rating.  I feel quite comfortable giving this movie that rating because it is my favorite movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the rating system doesn't go by technical merit.  People should rate films based on their opinion as a whole and not solely upon how well the director uses cinematic techniques.  Personally, I couldn't care less"
954,True,"Contains minor spoilers""The Shawshank Redemption"" has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are absolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are very likeable and the ""bad guys"" (warden + guards) are really evil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It has some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist at the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the persistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets him down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in himself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies cliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird, and the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace is a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it left me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At least not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well, it's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars"
955,True,"I find it very interesting that this movie has ranked so high in this database.  One professional reviewer elsewhere had referred to it as an ""overrated cult film,"" and I can see why.  It is one of those movies that is so unique that it just grabs hold of some people while doing very poorly with the general public at the box office.   But to be ranked as one of the best movies of all time?  I honestly don't see why.Personally, I thought the Stephen King story it was based on was much better.  True to his style, it was a very surrealistic tale about something that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  SPOILER AHEAD!  Come on, it is sheer fantasy to think that someone can dig himself out of prison with a rock pick over the course of many years without someone catching on to what he is doing.  I think that's why the movie is so popular:  it's a feel-good fantasy that pretends to be a prison drama.But it is very entertaining, and keeps you wondering if Andy really did kill his wife.  The ending is too predictable, though.Overall it is a very well-acted and directed movie.  However, the objectionable language and the homosexual rape scenes were totally unnecessary to the plot.  It would have been MUCH better if those aspects of Stephen King's fertile imagination had been left out of the movie.  If not for those parts, I would heartily recommend anyone to see it."
956,False,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
957,False,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
958,False,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
959,False,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
960,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"
961,False,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."
962,False,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
963,False,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."
964,False,"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"
965,False,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."
966,False,"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"
967,False,"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."
968,False,"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes."
969,False,"This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be."
970,False,"This film is really an amazing movie timeless. One of my all time favorites. About the long-can write something in a movie.

971,False,"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge..."
972,False,"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one."
973,False,"None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film."
974,False,"It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10"
975,False,"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life"
976,False,"Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there."
977,False,"At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor."
978,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!"
979,False,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10."
980,False,"this is the first time i am really wand to write something about thismovie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so,,,, anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one,,,movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life,,,anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u,,,, watch it and be inspired,,,thats all i can say,,,it will change the way u think about things around u,,never let it die in u,,,"
981,False,"Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through"
982,False,"When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !"
983,False,"I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope."
984,False,"Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that ""Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him."" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip ""The Letter Duet"" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: ""Music makes you free!"" The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any ""corrupted decency."" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony..."" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: ""Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!"" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?"
985,False,"I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.I hope..."
986,False,"Three words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever."
987,False,"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."
988,False,"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10"
989,False,"This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece."
990,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10."
991,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking."
992,False,"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact."
993,False,"This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!"
994,False,"My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."
995,False,"As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..""I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...""The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as ""Dumb-Ass"". Andy says....""its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction"" Then Red says..""Why don't we put it on Educational category?""(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as ""Educational"" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..""Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life"".Thanx to all."
996,False,"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10"
997,False,This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10.
998,False,"........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be some of you out thereWhat is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its release! In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check! In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance"" Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the ""predestined to an untimely end"" sidekickThe entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS! I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw- dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening WeekendA starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in! My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go by myselfMy wife, who is a rather avid movie goer, said""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW- What? No, ThanksI PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994! I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominatedEach one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden StatuetteWOW! As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to the USA invariably is the route that comes to mindnot the opposite, right!?!?!? Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlesslyCan't go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages! 10* STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
999,False,"Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)"
